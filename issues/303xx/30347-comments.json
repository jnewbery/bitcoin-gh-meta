Renaming Warning to Critical and Error to Fatal for the reasons given seems fine, but the old names shouldn't be kept around in that case.\r\n\r\nI think the reality is we already have 7 levels of logging, but we are using 5 names to describe them. This PR is a small fix to make the names used in the code match the intent of the code.\r\n\r\nFor example, the documentation says `LogError` should only be used to log fatal errors. But currently it is being used to log both fatal errors and nonfatal errors. If you would like to log errors less, or at lower priority, I would enthusiastically agree with that goal. But I don't think those changes should be folded into this PR, which is minimal and not trying to fix problems that are broader and more complicated than simple bad naming.\r\n\r\nYour [flowchart](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30347#discussion_r1657886163) is a good idealization, but it does not describe the realities of current code, which is using logging for ordinary error reporting, not just the most critical errors. A description of the actual log levels in our code base is:\r\n\r\n- `Fatal` messages indicate severe problems (e.g. data loss) that will trigger shutdowns\r\n- `Critical` messages indicate severe problems (e.g. incorrect system time, internal bug detected) that users should address in some way\r\n- `Error` messages indicate less severe problems (e.g. loss of connectivity) that the users should probably know about, but might be transient\r\n- `Warning` messages indicate unexpected conditions (e.g. user specified `-checkblocks` number higher than number of blocks that may be available to check) that the user should know about, and indicate potential problems\r\n\r\nFor completeness, `Info` messages provide information about normal activity, `Debug` messages can help users troubleshoot issues, and `Trace` is mostly unused but geared more towards developers.\r\n\r\nOverall, I agree with the direction you want to take in reducing number of log levels, and I would applaud any effort to reduce amount of log spam and report errors by other means, but I don't think those goals should get in the way of fixing names that are confusing and misleading to developers.\r\n\r\nIf you want to open a PR that takes a broader approach and also fixes the bad names, I will happily go along with it and close this PR. But I think reasonable to want to take one step at at time here and just fix the bad naming.",

It would be nice to spend time working on that, but we're instead constantly bikeshedding the API instead and treating that as a blocker for any other logging changes.\r\n\r\nThe logging was mostly migrated in the severity level parent PR #25203 before the whole thing was taken off the rails with the overwrought API and rules. (There have also been a number of pulls opened that were a copy or similar version of the commits there.)\r\n",
