Libraries can export globals, eg stdin, so I don't see why you're claiming it's necessary for the kernel when it's not even necessary for libc.\r\n\r\nBeing forced to eliminate all globals doesn't seem to be the claim here? As long as the globals don't carry over annoying state from previous usage, require annoying initialization, or aren't mostly safe from user misuse, their usage is fine. Next to what was brought up before about having the ability to distinguish between between the logged lines from multiple instances, there are a few other problems with the existing implementation that make its usage as a global annoying at the moment. If an instantiated logger is a red line here, we might be able to find other solutions though.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation buffers without a limit until `StartLogging()` is called. This forces the user to at least eventually call `StartLogging()`, even if they don't wish to consume logs. We could limit the buffer to some acceptably low amount, or ensure that `StartLogging()` is statically called when the library is loaded (similar to how the static secp context is created when bitcoin is started). This would discard previous logging messages though.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that any logs buffered before the user applies their own user-defined options will be printed in the default format and with default categories. Re-starting logging is also awkward to do at the moment.\r\n\r\nLogging is workable for the kernel library as is, but it would be nice to address the remaining pain points. I think having instantiated logging would be the best way to solve these issues, making it clear to the user when something will be logged, as well as giving guarantees on its format.\r\n",
