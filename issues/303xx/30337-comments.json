There are a lot of open issues of any difficulty waiting to be fixed. However, before you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build system and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build Bitcoin Core and how to run the unit and functional tests. Once that is done, you are all set.\r\n\r\nIf you need more help getting started, please refer to the following resources:\r\n\r\n* https://bitcoincore.academy/\r\n* https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365\r\n* https://jonatack.github.io/articles/how-to-review-pull-requests-in-bitcoin-core\r\n\r\n### Pick something to work on\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for useful contributions to help out with, you can\r\n\r\n* Spend time on in-depth review of open pull requests and compare your review with the review done by others. This may be time-consuming, but it will teach you relevant skills for this project and for yourself to apply elsewhere. Moreover, on some pull requests there remain small follow-ups that were found during review, so you'll naturally find stuff to work on if you start out by reviewing pull requests done by others.\r\n* Search through the [good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)s or the ones that are [up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22). Some of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but unsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\r\n* Write tests to improve the coverage. Any kind of test is welcome and coverage information can be obtained from a relatively recent [coverage report](https://maflcko.github.io/b-c-cov). If you are unsure, don't hesitate to check back first.\r\n* Help with review and testing. There are easy ones such as the [gui](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pulls) and [rpc](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3ARPC%2FREST%2FZMQ). However, review on any open pull request is welcome. Review will also help you understand the codebase better.\r\n* Help on meta projects related to Bitcoin Core, such as https://github.com/corecheck.\r\n* Join the Bitcoin Core IRC channel(s) and leave a comment to share what you are interested in.",
