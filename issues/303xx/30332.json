There may be other Stratum v2 roles we want to support in the future.\r\n\r\nOne such role could be a simple solo mining pool, in which an ASIC with native sv2 support sends shares directly to the node and we broadcast the block if a share hits the target. Like the Template Provider it would (eventually) be its own process, listening on a different port.\r\n\r\nThe above example just serves to illustrate why the logic of managing (inbound) connections shouldn't be in the `Sv2TemplateProvider` class. Perhaps we need something akin to `CConnman` for stratum.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the code in `ThreadSv2Handler` reused a lot of code from `CConnman::SocketHandlerConnected`. I'd like to find a way to extract this common functionality and put it somewhere else.\r\n\r\nFinally, because the tests use a real socket, they're quite brittle, so I plan to refactor them to take advantage of #30205. \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] use mock sockets from #30205\r\n- [ ] introduce something like a `CConnman` for stratum",
