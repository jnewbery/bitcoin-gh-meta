   "body" : "As a programmer, when I see `LogError` and `LogWarning` macros, I assume `LogError` should be used to log information about a failure that happened, and `LogWarning` should be used to log information about an unusual condition which happened that might indicate a real problem depending on other factors and intent.\r\n\r\nBut [developer notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b27afb7fb774809c9c075d56e44657e0b607a00c/doc/developer-notes.md#logging) suggest very different meanings for these macros. They say `LogError` should be used for \"severe problems that require the node (or a subsystem) to shut down entirely (e.g., insufficient storage space)\" and that `LogWarning` should be used \"for severe problems that the node admin should address, but are not severe enough to warrant shutting down the node (e.g., system time appears to be wrong, unknown soft fork appears to have activated).\"\r\n\r\nI think the distinction the developer notes makes and the levels it defines are useful, but the current names make it likely that the macros will be used incorrectly.\r\n\r\nSo while the macros are new, I think it would be good to give them clearer names and I would suggest:\r\n\r\n- `LogFatal` for severe problems that require the node or a subsystem to shut down entirely, and\r\n- `LogCritical` for severe problems that the node admin should address, but do not warrant shutting down\r\n\r\nLooking at the code I found 58 cases where `LogError` and `Level::Error` appeared to be use correctly, in conditions that would lead to full or partial shutdowns, and 71 cases where it appeared to be used incorrectly to report errors that would not cause shutdowns and were potentially transient.\r\n\r\nCurrent `LogWarning` and `Level::Warn` usages were better but more rare, with 8 correct uses and 4 incorrect ones.\r\n\r\nI think before more code is written and ported to use the new macros, we should give them better names that will accurately reflect what the log messages mean and how the macros are intended to be used.\r\n\r\nI wrote #30347 to address this, clarifying documentation, and using LogFatal and LogCritical names suggested above, but I am interested to know if there other ideas for different names or better approaches. Or if there is not a real issue here and the current names should be kept.",
