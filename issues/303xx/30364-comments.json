I think developers will be less likely to use a level called \"alert\" for minor errors and warnings, and will more appropriately use the debug log level instead.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this PR gets rid of the ability to distinguish warnings and errors from informational messages and fatal errors at an API level. But this might not be a big problem if messages are clearly written and have \"Error:\" \"Warning:\" \"Internal bug detected:\" \"Fatal error\" and similar prefixes. Also practically speaking I think we are already logging most errors and warnings at the \"info\" and \"debug\" levels anyway so maybe this makes the API match current code better.\r\n\r\nAgain, though I don't have strong feeling about this change. It just seemed like it would be simple to implement and the results look pretty clean, IMO, so I think it's worth looking at and considering.",
