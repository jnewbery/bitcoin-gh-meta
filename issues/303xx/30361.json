Of 129 current uses only 58 cases are fatal according to [#30348](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30348)\r\n\r\n- \"[T]here's not much benefit in a log that says \"hey this error is about to cause the node to stop\" -- you already get that information by seeing \"Shutdown: in progress...\" immediately following.\" according to [#30347 (comment)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30347#discussion_r1659096893)\r\n\r\nThis PR is a draft because it is a potential solution to #30348 and a potential alternative to #30347.
