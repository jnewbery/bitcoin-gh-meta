Parent PR #29432.\r\n\r\nIntroduces `Sv2Transport::Transport` which is very similar to `V2Transport`.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n* shoehorn `Sv2NetMsg` into a `CSerializedNetMsg` in `SetMessageToSend` (currently broken)\r\n* shoehorn `Sv2NetMsg` into a `CNetMessage` in `GetReceivedMessage` (currently works)\r\n* use `BytesToSend` instead of `Sv2BytesToSend`? (currently works)\r\n\r\nSee discussion in #30209.\r\n\r\nThe first few commits move some network related code from Node to Common. My goal is to make the Stratum v2 Template Provider independent of the Node so it can run in a separate process - so it doesn't take the whole node down if there's a bug (after #10102).\r\n\r\nThose refactor commits are orthogonal to the main work here though, I'll make a separate PR for them once people are happy with the overall direction.",
