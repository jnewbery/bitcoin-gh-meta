It may make sense to do this after signing your inputs and outputs during a manual coinjoin as demonstrated in the [BIP174 example](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki#manual-coinjoin-workflow).\r\n\r\nTo me, this makes more sense to include in the [`Combiner`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0174.mediawiki#combiner) PSBT role. It's then separated from signing done by the `Signers`. \r\n\r\nTherefore add functionality to `combinepsbt` permitting stripping of **all** `bip32_derivation` paths found in all provided psbts' inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nAs this RPC can be called with a single PSBT, it can be used to strip derivation paths from a PSBT with an y number of participants.\r\n",
