      "body" : "I think both entries should continue to include examples.\r\n\r\nI think removing \"severe\" from the LogWarning description doesn't make sense -- anything the admin might have to address is a severe (potential) problem, isn't it?\r\n\r\nHaving LogError mean \"the node admin **will** need to address\" vs LogWarning mean \"the node admin **may** need to address\" seems to argue towards retaining the \"LogError is fatal\" interpretation to me -- fatal errors are ones the admin does need address; anything else they can ignore until it becomes fatal.\r\n\r\nA potential advantage of having LogError (or LogFatal) reserved for fatal errors is that you could grep through the codebase for LogError to see all the potentially fatal errors, and perhaps work on finding ways to make them less fatal. Not convinced that's very beneficial though.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much other benefit to splitting potential problems up from actual problems otherwise if the admin still needs to attend to them either way, though; so if we're already making LogError just mean actual errors; is there any reason not to merge them both into a single LogAlert() or similar?",
