This is particularly relevant for the net-specific case. In Bitcoin Core, `GetDataDir(true)` gets called before `GetBlocksDir()` but seemingly by accident: the former is called during `InitLogging` when fetching the default debug.log location, and the latter during `AppInitParameterInteraction` shortly afterwards. If `InitLogging` were changed slightly, it could inadvertently cause testnet/regtest to stop creating wallets/ directory.\r\n* If someone creates the ~/.bitcoin directory just to host the bitcoin.conf before running first time, it won't create the mainnet wallets/ subdirectory.\r\n* If running in -nowallet mode, it still creates the wallets/ directory. If running -regtest and -nowallet, it creates *two* wallets/ directories (the mainnet one and net-specific one) since both `GetDataDir(false)` and `GetDataDir(true)` get called during init.\r\n* If a user were to run in -nowallet, then deleted the empty and apparently superfluous wallets/ directory, it will not get recreated if later run with wallet enabled. Then bitcoind will instead create wallet.dat in the bare directory.\r\n* If bitcoind is compiled without wallet support, it still creates wallets/ directory (sometimes).\r\n\r\nI think a more elegant solution would be to have wallets/ directory created in the wallet initialization, however I'm not an expert on the wallet part of the code and how this ought to behave.\r\n\r\n(pinging @meshcollider from original PR)",
