   "body" : "This PR is a child of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 and only implements the sending logic. For the rest:\r\n\r\n* #28122 - implement the silent payments scheme\r\n* #28202 - implements receiving\r\n* #27827 - all three PRs together - this PR is meant for tracking progress and is useful for reviewers who want to compile all three PRs at once for testing\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #28122 and is marked as a draft until it is merged. Commits up to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/8ee791e7b34a354ce6835b968fe12924b8908d7c belong to #28122; please review those commits on #28122\r\n\r\n## Sending \r\n\r\n### Add a new `Destination` variant\r\n\r\nThe first 4 commits of this PR are a refactor to introduce a new destination type for silent payments. Both a single-use scriptPubKey and a silent payments destination have a lot in common:\r\n\r\n* An amount\r\n* Instructions on where to send the money (either a `scriptPubKey` or instructions for creating `scriptPubKeys`\r\n* SFFO information\r\n\r\nMost of the steps in creating a transaction are the same, whether it's a silent payment destination or a single scriptPubKey. Therefore, a new `Destination` std::variant is introduced which can hold either a `CRecipient` or a `V0SilentPaymentDestination`, along with functions for accessing the attributes of the underlying types using a visitor pattern.\r\n\r\nThese commits are best reviewed with something like `git diff -w --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`\r\n\r\n### Silent Payments logic\r\n\r\nNext, new functions are introduced for:\r\n\r\n* Applying the Taptweak to a taproot internal private key (this is a copy-paste of the code for applying the taptweak in the signing process)\r\n* Getting a private key from a given `scriptPubKey`\r\n* Creating silent payment outputs (i.e. creating and using the `Sender` class from `wallet/silentpayments.h`\r\n* Separating a vector of `Destinations` into `CRecipient` and `V0SilentPaymentDestination` vectors\r\n\r\nEach of these functions is introduced as it's own commit. The functions are then used together to create silent payment outputs during `CreateTransactionInternal`.\r\n\r\n### Final steps\r\n\r\nThe last commits ensure that:\r\n\r\n* Coin selection is silent payments aware and knows to exclude taproot script path spends and inputs with unknown witness when funding a transaction which pays to a silent payment address\r\n* The change output type is correctly chosen when paying to a silent payment address\r\n* Functional tests\r\n",
