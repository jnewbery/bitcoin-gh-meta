   "body" : "This PR is supposed to provide context for some of the refactoring PRs I've been working on (#25268, #26621, etc).\r\n\r\nThe aim is to completely decouple CConnman and its internals from PeerManager to allow for isolated testing of our message processing code (isolated from net only as isolating from validation is another can of worms). To get there, this work refactors CConnman's API to use `NodeId` as the primary handle for managing connections and defines a new interface `ConnectionsInterface` that describes the interface between PeerManager and CConnman. The result is that CNode is no longer part of this interface and access to it is no longer needed within net processing.\r\n\r\nMost of the API simply shifts from `CConnman::DoX(CNode*)` to `CConnman::DoX(NodeId)` and where possible the PR minimizes the need for new methods on `CConnman` to avoid the slight overhead of (internally) locking `m_nodes_mutex` to look up the right `CNode` by its id.\r\n\r\nSome steps this PR is taking:\r\n\r\n- [ ] We can't test PeerManager in isolation if it is not the owner of its own state. Therefore this PR moves all the remaining application layer data from net to net processing.\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing only accesses constant data that is available from the time of connection establishment. This PR introduces `ConnectionContext` which is meant to hold all this constant connection data and for each connection a copy is stored on the corresponding `Peer` instance. This reduces the need for accessing CNode in net processing and avoids some `For{Each}Node` calls (which are a horrible layer violation).\r\n- [ ] Some use of CNode in net processing directly modifies eviction related members of CNode. Instead of wrapping access to these members in CConnman methods, this PR creates a new manager (EvictionManager) that encapsulates the eviction logic as well as the required per-peer data (entirely removing the relevant CNode members).\r\n- [ ] To disconnect a peer , PeerManager directly sets the disconnection flag `CNode::fDisconnect` to true. This PR wraps access to that flag on `CConnman`, i.e. `CConnman::IsDisconnected` & `CConnman::DisconnectNode(NodeId)`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PR also introduces initial unit tests for PeerManager that make use of a mocked `ConnectionsInterface` instead of the actual CConnman.\r\n\r\nLooking for conceptual & approach review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is not super polished so I would expect the CI to fail but I will break this up and polish if there is enough conceptual support. I will not keep this rebased as the general architectural direction this is taking should be clear in any case.",
