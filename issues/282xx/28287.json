   "body" : "This adds a `sendmsgtopeer` rpc (for testing only) that allows a node to send a message (provided in hex) to a peer.\r\nWhile we would usually use a `p2p` object instead of a node for this in the test framework, that isn't possible in situations where this message needs to trigger an actual interaction of multiple nodes.\r\n\r\nUse this rpc to add test coverage for the bug fixed in #27981 (that just got merged):\r\nThe test lets two nodes (almost) simultaneously send a single large (4MB) p2p message to each other, which would have caused a deadlock previously (making this test fail), but succeeds now.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the discussion in #27981, it was not easy to reproduce this bug without `sendmsgtopeer`. I would imagine that `sendmsgtopeer` could also be helpful in various other test constellations.",
