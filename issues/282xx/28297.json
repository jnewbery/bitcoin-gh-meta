Although in principle our current use of it shouldn't cause a problem.\r\n\r\nI checked to see if perhaps Apple has improved things since 2018. They moved the repo, so the `knote_fdfind` implementation is now here: https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blame/main/bsd/kern/kern_event.c#L6198\r\n\r\nOther than using a reference on one line (`struct filedesc *fdp = &p->p_fd;`) nothing has changed.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we should probably leave things as they are for now, unless there's another pressing reason to prefer `poll()` over `select()`.",
