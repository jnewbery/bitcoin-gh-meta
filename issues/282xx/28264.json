   "body" : "In wallet-related functional tests we often want to send funds to an address and  use the resulting (non-change) UTXO directly after as input for another transaction. Doing that is currently tedious, as it involves finding the index part of the outpoint manually by calling helpers like `find_vout_for_address` or `find_output` first.  This results in two different txid/vout variables which then again have to be combined to a single dictionary `{\"txid\": ..., \"vout\": ...}` in order to be specified as input for RPCs like `createrawtransaction` or `createpsbt`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntxid1 = node.sendtoaddress(addr1, value1)\r\nvout1 = find_vout_for_address(node, txid1, addr1)\r\ntxid2 = node.sendtoaddress(addr2, value2)\r\nvout2 = find_vout_for_address(node, txid2, addr2)\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([{'txid': txid1, 'vout': vout1}, {'txid': txid2, 'vout': vout2}], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a helper `sendtoaddress_and_get_outpoint` to immediately return the outpoint as\r\nUTXO dictionary in the common format, making the tests more readable and avoiding unnecessary duplication:\r\n\r\n```\r\nutxo1 = sendtoaddress_and_get_outpoint(node, addr1, value1)\r\nutxo2 = sendtoaddress_and_get_outpoint(node, addr2, value2)\r\nnode.createrawtransaction([utxo1, utxo2], .....)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests are switched to work with UTXO-objects rather than two individual txid/vout variables accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe `find_output` helper is removed, as it seems generally a bad idea to search for an outpoint only based on the output value. If that's really ever needed in the future, it makes probably more sense to add it as an additional parameter to `find_vout_of_address`. Note that `find_output` supported specifying a block-hash for where to look for the transaction (being passed on to the `getrawtransaction` RPC). This seems to be unneeded, as txids are always unique and for the only test that used that parameter (rpc_psbt.py) there was no observed difference in run-time, so it was not reintroduced in the new helper.\r\n\r\nThere are still some `find_vout_of_address` calls remaining, used for detecting change outputs or for whenever the sending doesn't happen via `sendtoaddress` (e.g. using `send` instead for specifying multiple outputs), so this PR tackles not all, but the most common case.\r\n\r\nIf this is Concept ACKed, I'd be glad to also receive naming suggestions for the new helper, still not 100% happy with it.",
