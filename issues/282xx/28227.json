   "body" : "This PR checks for specific disconnect reasons using `assert_debug_log` in the functional test `p2p_blockfilters.py`. With that we ensure that the disconnect happens for the expected reason and also makes it easier to navigate between implementation and test code, i.e. both the questions \"do we have test coverage for this disconnect cause?\" (from an implementation reader's perspective) and \"where is the code handling this disconnect cause?\" (from a test reader's perspective) can be answered simply by grep-ping the corresponding debug message.\r\n\r\nAlso, based on that, missing coverage for the (start height > stop height) disconnect case is added:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b7138252ace6d21476964774e094ed1143cd7a1c/src/net_processing.cpp#L3050-L3056\r\n",
