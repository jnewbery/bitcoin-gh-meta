Spam from taproot lifting the limit on scriptsigs far exceeds the legitimate uses of all p2sh usage.  Lifting the script sig without validating the input is a bug no one wants to admit exists. I can decode a hex scriptsig to ASCII which clearly prints \"Adobe Lightroom\" meta tags because it's NOT A SCRIPT SIG. That is a bug as it doesn't validate the content is a scriptsig. \r\n\r\nLike you said Core has the responsibility to protect against this attack vector.",

In case you forgot it's inspcriptions that have led to the largest blocks ever on bitcoin, not bare p2sh.\r\n> \r\n> If we followed the logic proposed in your response we should also roll back taproot and replace the limit on the script sigs. Spam from taproot lifting the limit on scriptsigs far exceeds the legitimate uses of all p2sh usage. Lifting the script sig without validating the input is a bug no one wants to admit exists. I can decode a hex scriptsig to ASCII which clearly prints \"Adobe Lightroom\" meta tags because it's NOT A SCRIPT SIG. That is a bug as it doesn't validate the content is a scriptsig.\r\n> \r\n> Like you said Core has the responsibility to protect against this attack vector.\r\n\r\nThis is a separate issue that is indeed more critical and should also be addressed, but the fact that a worse attack vector exists is not a valid reason to shrug other ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, since you brought it up I want to point out that Taproot lifting the 10k limit on scripts has not been the main issue with inscriptions. Bloating the blocks with huge data streams is bad enough for full nodes, but bloating the UTXO set is worse and in the last 4 moths it has grown at an unprecedented 40%[^1] due to a tidal wave of BRC-20 transactions that pay more fees than sats they move just to inscribe small json payloads that are well below 10k bytes[^2].\r\n\r\nFortunately detecting these transactions does not involve decoding the script and looking for ASCII strings or some other patterns of data. It's as simple as detecting the `OP_0` `OP_IF` data envelope in the script, and an unofficial patch that does that has been circulating informally since early February[^3]. I see no reason why a more refined version of this patch (with proper unit tests etc) should not make its way into Bitcoin Core eventually, as it's the same kind of issue (and mitigation) we're dealing in here.\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://statoshi.info/d/000000009/unspent-transaction-output-set?orgId=1&refresh=5s&from=now-1y&to=now&viewPanel=8\r\n![utxo_set](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/1456708/2062707d-e256-46de-951c-d695966be4ef)\r\n\r\n[^2]: See for instance [this transaction](https://mempool.space/tx/6e463cf71ebc8a374fa4f43fb6c60ab16551ef666b4f72d67efaa8e88db8d1ca) and its [block](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000004261d7e1e194c3dd45c6f5d3e5c2d46268f0215a26280), which is filled with other BRC-20 inscriptions.

Because most of bare multisig activity is never spent outputs, I focused on bare multisig inputs and how old the spent coins are.\r\n\r\nThere were 940 bare multisig inputs during the analyzed period. 28% of them were spending coins created in the same block, while the median coin age was 224 blocks, and 90% of the coins were 14,599 blocks or fewer old. So while the actual usage of bare multisig for transactions is low, it's not just people sweeping old wallets, and they would be negatively impacted by not being able to create new outputs.\r\n\r\nSo for now, assuming this change is adopted and the peer-to-peer network stops reliably relaying transactions creating bare multisig outputs, these appear to be the consequences:\r\n\r\n- People determined to store data in the UTXO set (which is a terrible idea, but they still do it) will move to a different output type (such as P2TR, or perhaps an unused 40-byte SegWit output type) with slightly lower encoding efficiency, with potentially worse consequences for the UTXO set size.\r\n- However, since the actual usage of bare multisig even for outputs is low, the actual consequences for the UTXO set are likely to be negligible either way.\r\n- A small minority of users who appear to actually be using bare multisig for transactions will be forced to move to a different output type.\r\n\r\nAs there don't appear to be any benefits of this change, it's a NACK from me.\r\n\r\nSide note, a proposal to change the default policy really should be accompanied (I'd even say preceded) by a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list.",

There are at least 200,000 BIP47 payment codes (that users have opted in to uploading to a public web directory) in the wild across three independent wallets - with more coming I am told. \r\n\r\nRegarding version 3 payment codes, we have fully implemented Version 3 of BIP47 into our wallet library ExtLibJ for over a year. See test vectors here https://code.samourai.io/wallet/ExtLibJ/-/blob/develop/src/test/java/com/samourai/wallet/bip47/rpc/obpp05/TestVectorsOBPP_RFC05.java\r\n\r\nI don't think it is wise to assume that no one is using BIP47 Version 3, nor should it be expected that developers come pay homage and plead their case to the maintainers and contributors of this repository as was suggested earlier in the comments.\r\n\r\nThank you @Davidson-Souza and @1ma for thinking of BIP47 in the context of this PR",

P2MS is just P2PK with the ability to bake up to 2 more pubkeys to the chain even if those pubkeys don't actually have known private keys.\r\n\r\n2. **Long term storage** because of the nature of P2SH and P2WSH scripts for multisig. The user is responsible for not only their private keys but also the public keys to recreate the script to spend their funds. P2MS is an incredible alternative to this since the user is only responsible for the private keys since the script exists on chain.\r\n\r\n3. **Security** P2MS offers 256*m bits of security which is higher than the 160bits of a P2SH script. It will in the future be easier to try to find hash collisions for a P2SH address than it will be to try to use pollard's rho to factor the private key.\r\n\r\n4. **Reducing Dust / Fee planning** Placing the scripts on chain reduces the cost to spend the UTXO since the script doesn't have to be provided to spend. This reduces the amount of dust. An added benefit is that over time if/as fees rise users that used P2MS would actually get a discount when spending compared to script hash based methods.\r\n\r\n5. **Application Demand** Over time users discover creative solutions to problems or add features. Just because something isn't used often today. Doesn't mean that it wont have prevalence tomorrow. \r\n\r\n6. **Slippery Slope and Moral Hazard** Relay policies like this are a form of censorship in it's own way. Just because we may not like the way one group is using something and none the less paying shouldn't be a cause to implement these policies. Only if something is genuinely causing issues and reducing the value of the network should policies be considered. \r\n\r\n_Example. What happens if FALSE IF becomes contentious? Would we start to consider new relay policies then?_\r\n\r\nedit: penalization, disincentivization may be better terms than censorship. My brain just interprets this as a change to the incentive structure by making the cost of communication (relaying) higher for those that want to use P2MS.\r\n",

The user is responsible for not only their private keys but also the public keys to recreate the script to spend their funds. P2MS is an incredible alternative to this since the user is only responsible for the private keys since the script exists on chain.\r\n> 3. **Security** P2MS offers 256*m bits of security which is higher than the 160bits of a P2SH script. It will in the future be easier to try to find hash collisions for a P2SH address than it will be to try to use pollard's rho to factor the private key.\r\n> 4. **Reducing Dust / Fee planning** Placing the scripts on chain reduces the cost to spend the UTXO since the script doesn't have to be provided to spend. This reduces the amount of dust. An added benefit is that over time if/as fees rise users that used P2MS would actually get a discount when spending compared to script hash based methods.\r\n> 5. **Application Demand** Over time users discover creative solutions to problems or add features. Just because something isn't used often today. Doesn't mean that it wont have prevalence tomorrow.\r\n> 6. **Slippery Slope and Moral Hazard** Relay policies like this are a form of censorship in it's own way. Just because we may not like the way one group is using something and none the less paying shouldn't be a cause to implement these policies. Only if something is genuinely causing issues and reducing the value of the network should policies be considered.\r\n> \r\n> _Example. What happens if FALSE IF becomes contentious?
