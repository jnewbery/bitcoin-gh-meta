But it's never the case (that's the whole point of using a cache).\r\n\r\nThe only reason this didn't result in a crash was that we would never actually hit these assertions. I ran into this while introducing a new target with an in-memory `CCoinsViewDB` as the backend view (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28216) which made the code paths with those assertions actually reachable.",
