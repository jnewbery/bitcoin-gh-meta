   "body" : "This PR adds fuzz coverage for `wallet/spend`.\r\n\r\nMotivation: Issue [27272](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27272#issue-1628327906)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds FuzzÂ coverage toÂ the wholeÂ conceptÂ of Creating a New Transaction as well as other sections of the Spend file.  Because `CreateTransaction` is one of the most frequently used functionsÂ in the wallet codebase, merging this PR will significantly improve the wallet codebase's Fuzz testing!\r\n\r\nI also used the `Singleton Class` concept for creating Wallet instances because it assures that only one instance of it is created during all Fuzz runs, which significantly boosts the file's `exec/sec`.\r\n",
