   "body" : "Switch to using smart pointers to `CNode`s inside of `CConnman`.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are manually refcounting CNodes which is potentially error-prone and makes operations such as deleting them from multiple threads difficult without introducing new locks or other synchronisation operations (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27912).\r\n\r\nSwitch to using `std::shared_ptr` references to `CNode`s inside of `m_nodes` and `m_nodes_disconnected` to give us better memory safety today, and in the future allow `AttemptToEvictConnection` (and optionally other sites) to safely synchronously disconnect nodes when needed.\r\n\r\nOpening as draft for now as I want to both gauge feedback on the approach, and see which PRs this may conflict with (#27213?) before moving it forwards.\r\n\r\nCC @vasild ",
