I assumed that this meant it was a valid block, but that's not always the case. With this patch, if we receive more blocks on top of this invalid block that give us more work than the tip, the `BlockChecked` callback will run and won't find the peer to punish. I can't think of a scenario where you're sure that you can remove from `mapBlockSource` unless the peer disconnects.",

This should be extremely expensive to do, and more likely a growing data structure merely due to chance stale tips.\r\n\r\nDoes this match your understanding?",
