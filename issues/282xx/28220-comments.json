Every node has its own policies, and relying on any specific policy is broken by design.\r\n\r\nWhile each node can set its own transaction relay policy, economically rational nodes are expected to follow the set of rules yielding the highest feerate traffic, at the very least for the ones partaking in block template construction if they wish to stay competitive mining entities.\r\n\r\nIf the default set of transaction relay rules do not yield the highest feerate traffic modulo the restrictions for DoS robustness, this is certainly a defect or imperfections that should be fixed, and this in fact the work pursued by BIP331 / nversion3 and its implementation in Bitcoin Core to the best of my understanding.\r\n\r\nIn light of this economical rationality design goal, second-layers protocols can be designed accordingly and issue transactions ensuring theyâre understood and relayed by the economically rational nodes on the transaction relay network. If they assume uneconomic transaction-relay behavior in their design and requirements, they should be fixed in consequence.\r\n\r\nIf there is a wish to define further âeconomically rationalâ I can propose the lineaments of a game-theory model of Bitcoin transaction-relay, including miners strategy on the mailing list. In the meantime, this work is only exposing our mempool validation interface than one could leverage by direct p2p message to a full-node.",
