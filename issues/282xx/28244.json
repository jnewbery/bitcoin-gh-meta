   "body" : "Some future work needs to touch things in script/standard.{h/cpp}, however it is unclear if it is safe to do so as they are included in several different places that could effect standardness and consensus. It contains a mix of policy parameters, consensus parameters, and utilities only used by the wallet. This PR breaks up the various components and renames the files to clearly separate everything.\r\n\r\n* `CTxDestination` is moved to a new file `src/addresstype.{cpp/h}`\r\n* `TaprootSpendData` and `TaprootBuilder` (and their utility functions and structs) are moved to `SigningProvider` as these are used only during signing.\r\n* `CScriptID` is moved to `script/script.h` to be next to `CScript`.\r\n* `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS` is moved to `interpreter.h`\r\n* The parameters `DEFAULT_ACCEPT_DATACARRIER` and `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY` are moved to `policy.h`\r\n* `standard.{cpp/h}` is renamed to `solver.{cpp/h}` since that's all that's left in the file after the above moves",
