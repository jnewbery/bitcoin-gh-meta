   "body" : "GH has introduced new \"Alert\" syntax for md files (a.k.a \"Admonitions\" in other languages).\r\n\r\nWhilst being wary of changing documentation just for the sake of \"shiny\" new features, in my opinion this is worthwhile in this case as we can use it to draw user attention to particularly important sections of docs.\r\n\r\nThe format is relatively backwards-compatible (i.e outside of GH), as the syntax is effectively a multi-block quotation, where the first line includes the alert type. This means the text still renders fine outside of GH, but is improved on GH. Samples below:\r\n\r\nGitHub render:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/34282644-bf21-42d8-bbe6-6f18069a3081)\r\n\r\nHackmd render:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/6606587/d88a98a8-e9c0-4dce-abf1-58f59de9c6a5)\r\n\r\nSee e.g. https://github.com/willcl-ark/bitcoin/blob/2023-08-gh-alerts/doc/managing-wallets.md for a doc containing a few alerts.\r\n\r\nOpening as draft for now to see if others would consider such a change worthwhile, not interested in bike-shedding over which alert level is used where, for now :) But for reference GH provides [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) with _their_ recommended usage of alert levels, which I did try to roughly use in this draft. \r\n\r\n",
