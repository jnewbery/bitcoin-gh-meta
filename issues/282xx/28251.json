   "body" : "While we are evaluating a package, we split it into \"subpackages\" for evaluation (currently subpackages all have size 1 except the last one). If a subpackage has size 1, we may add a tx to mempool and call `LimitMempoolSize()`, which evicts transactions if the mempool gets full. We handle the case where the just-submitted transaction is evicted immediately, but we don't handle the case in which a transaction from a previous subpackage (either just submitted or already in mempool) is evicted. Mainly, since the coins created by the evicted transaction are cached in `m_view`, we don't realize the UTXO has disappeared until `CheckInputsFromMempoolAndCache` asserts that they exist. Also, the returned `PackageMempoolAcceptResult` reports that the transaction is in mempool even though it isn't anymore.\r\n\r\nFix this by not calling `LimitMempoolSize()` until the very end, and editing the results map with \"mempool full\" if things fall out.\r\n\r\nPointed out by instagibbs in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/faeed687e5cde5e32750d93818dd1d4add837f24 on top of the v3 PR.",
