However, I made the mistake of having the Bitcoin core Program on the portable HDD itself.\n> \n> Bitcoin Core was still able to run from your external HDD/SSD correct?\n\nIt was able to run yes. \n\nHowever, it kept on wanting to re-sync up again from 0.0%\n\nEven when the full block file of 530gb was already on the HDD. \n\nIt was as if it wasn't detecting that the full Bitcoin Blockchain was already there on the HDD. \n\nBut when I installed the Bitcoin Core program on to the \"C\" drive. Then told it where it should write the new Bitcoin Data it then started at 95% synced, and followed further with 100% synced. \n\nProblems solved. ",

      "body" : "So the issue originates with the default search location for the bitcoin.conf file. That file likely didn't contain the datadir flag when it was first installed to the external drive. By reinstalling to C: you triggered the prompt that requests location of the datadir and then writes that to bitcoin.conf after the confirm. As such after completing the dialog the location of your blocks was stored.\r\n\r\n[See this wiki about the bitcoin data directory](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Data_directory)\r\n\r\nAs a test could you reinstall to the external drive in a fresh directory and let me know if the data directory popup shows on the first launch?
