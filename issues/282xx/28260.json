It is however an uncomfortable pitfall for future development.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe function should either make sure to never access anything beyond or at the end pointer, or should document this requirement properly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nchar innocentChar = 'n';\r\ngetJsonToken(/*...*/, &innocentChar, (&innocentChar) + 1);\r\n```\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nOther\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nmaster@3654d84\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nCommon code issue, os irrelevant\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
