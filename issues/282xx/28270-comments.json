      "body" : "This would not be possible without a large refactor. The Bitcoin-core npm package is very good for communicating with the bitcoind server to run RPC commands, the internal testing suite of python code spins up various instances of bitcoind with different flags and executes commands against those instances. You would have to replicate this in JS. As such this is more of a discussion topic and not an issue.\r\n\r\nAll in all the npm Bitcoin core package would not  be a good candidate as a wrapper for test_runner.py  \r\n\r\nThis issue should be closed.",
