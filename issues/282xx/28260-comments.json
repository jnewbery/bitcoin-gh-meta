I have unit tests for the keywords (true, false, null) but want to add some for the numbers.\r\n\r\nHaven't made any progress on MSAN. But if we would poison data around begin and end, we could write some exhaustive tests for small inputs. If we restrict to (printable characters, or these mentioned in the code), we could then be pretty certain the new code is correct. \r\n\r\nTouching code is always a risk, so I am trying to minimize it.\r\n\r\nFWIW, my code so far: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b77afc50b14ea1af61ea3b32e75d2aa974b07844\r\n\r\n",
