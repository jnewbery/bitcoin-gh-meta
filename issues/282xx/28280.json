   "body" : "Since https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17487 we no longer need to clear the coins cache when syncing to disk. A warm coins cache significantly speeds up block connection, and only needs to be fully flushed when nearing the `dbcache` limit.\r\n\r\nFor frequent pruning flushes there's no need to empty the cache and kill connect block speed. However, simply using `Sync` in place of `Flush` actually slows down a pruned full IBD with a high `dbcache` value. This is because as the cache grows, sync takes longer since every coin in the cache is scanned to check if it's dirty. For frequent prune flushes and a large cache this constant scanning starts to really slow IBD down, and just emptying the cache on every prune becomes faster.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we can add two pointers to each cache entry and construct a doubly linked list of dirty entries. We can then only iterate through all dirty entries on each `Sync`, and simply clear the pointers after.\r\n\r\nWith this approach a full IBD with `dbcache=16384` and `prune=550` was 32% faster than master. For default `dbcache=450` speedup was ~9%. All benchmarks were run with `stopatheight=800000`.\r\n\r\n|  | prune | dbcache | time | max RSS | speedup |\r\n|-----------:|----------:|------------:|--------:|-------------:|--------------:|\r\n| master | 550 | 16384 | 8:52:57 | 2,417,464k | - |\r\n| branch | 550 | 16384 | 6:01:00 | 16,216,736k | 32% |\r\n| branch | 550 | 450 | 8:05:08 | 2,818,072k | 8.8% |\r\n| master | 10000 | 5000 | 8:19:59 | 2,962,752k | - |\r\n| branch | 10000 | 5000| 5:56:39 | 6,179,764k | 28.8% |\r\n| master | 0 | 16384 | 4:51:53 | 14,726,408k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 16384 | 4:43:11 | 16,526,348k | 2.7% |\r\n| master | 0 | 450 | 7:08:07 | 3,005,892k | - |\r\n| branch | 0 | 450 | 6:57:24 | 3,013,556k |2.6%|\r\n\r\nWhile the 2 pointers add memory to each cache entry, it did not slow down IBD. For non-pruned IBD results were similar for this branch and master. A non-pruned IBD with full `dbcache` to tip ended up using 12% more memory, but it was also 2.7% faster somehow. For smaller `dbcache` values the `dbcache` limit is respected so does not consume more memory, and the potentially more frequent flushes were not significant enough to cause any slowdown.\r\n\r\nInspired by [this comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15265#issuecomment-457720636).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11315.",
