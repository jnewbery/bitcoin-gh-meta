For example, if we need X transactions to reconstruct the block, we could request Y transactions in GETBLOCKTXN where we have the other Y-X transactions. Adding these decoy transactions increases the BLOCKTXN response and could cause more round trips. We would also have to ignore the known transactions in BLOCKTXN.\r\n\r\nIf there are too many txn's that we're missing, we could fall back to block relay instead of trying to add many decoy transactions. According to [this data point](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27086#issuecomment-1426937832), compact block reconstruction works pretty well. Most of the time no reconstruction happens and sometimes only a few txn's are needed. So falling back to block relay should be unlikely.\r\n\r\nSince quick compact block relay is pretty important to avoid stale blocks, I'm not really sure how to weigh the privacy-bandwidth tradeoff.\r\n",
