What are the known forms of mutated blocks?\r\n\r\nLooking at `IsBlockMutated` in this PR should provide the answers for these questions, but to recap:\r\n\r\n* When we receive a block it contains a header and a list of transactions. The header contains a merkle root hash (`CBlock::hashMerkleRoot`) which should commit to the list of transactions but [if it doesn't the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3660-L3671).\r\n* The coinbase transaction (post segwit) contains a commitment (very similar to the merkle root in the header) to the witness data in a block. [If that commitment does not actually commit to the witnesses that were received, the block is considered mutated](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b2b2b1e9e415c3b5f74d517eaebfc2073cef5175/src/validation.cpp#L3861-L3896).\r\n* Our merkle root algorithm has several flaws which allow for further malleation, see [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/attachments/20190225/a27d8837/attachment-0001.pdf) for a great overview.",
