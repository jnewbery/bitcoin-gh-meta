Now that `HAVE_CONFIG_H` is no longer included in low-level (standalone) headers, I don't see the need for it anymore. If there is a header that can be built standalone, and needs `HAVE_CONFIG_H`, let me know. I think iwyu already has `HAVE_CONFIG_H` defined, so only the `pragma` change is needed to fix the iwyu suggestions for this header. I am happy to drop the `HAVE_CONFIG_H` change, but unless there is still a reason to keep `HAVE_CONFIG_H`, it seems less brittle to me to drop it.\r\n\r\nAbout your other suggested (unrelated) cleanups: There is also a discussion about moving from `#ifdef` to `#if` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/16419). If this was done for all symbols in the config header, the iwyu pragma would no longer be needed, I presume. Though, I won't be working on this myself. I mostly care about the changes in this pull request. If someone reworks the build system to make this pull request obsolete, I wouldn't mind :)",
