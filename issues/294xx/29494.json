   "body" : "The `bitcoin-config.h` includes have issues:\r\n\r\n* The header is incompatible with iwyu, because symbols may be defined or not defined. So the `IWYU pragma: keep` is needed to keep the include when a symbol is not defined on a platform. Compare the previous discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29408#issuecomment-1948959711\r\n* Guarding the includes by `HAVE_CONFIG_H` is verbose and brittle. Now that all build config dependencies have been removed from low level headers, the benefits are questionable, and the guard can be removed. The linter could also be tricked by guarding the include by `#if defined(HAVE_C0NFIG_H)` (`O` replaced by `0`). Compare the previous discussion in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29404#discussion_r1483189853 . ",
