Maybe you can kick off that effort?\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the core wallet, but with the related GUI project I am helping with, we are trying to create solid design documentation from the start ([see here](https://bitcoincore.app)), which may also end up including a good amount of feature specs. We're still early in this, but I do think it's worth the effort to document things well. It gets easier to make decisions, newcomers can more easily understand the goals and status, you avoid repeatedly having the same conversations, etc.",
