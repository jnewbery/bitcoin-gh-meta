We removed the compression step from the macOS DMG creation, to further slim down our macOS toolchain, and by removing `dmg`, made it possible to have cross-architecture builds for the macOS HOSTS (including the native `dmg` tool would have prevented this). However not compressing resulted in a release dmg that, iirc,  didn't have a certain header bit set, which meant that on-mount, the Finder window wouldn't popup as it previously would have.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that this shouldn't be too much of an issue, as the DMG still mounts, and it's just a case of picking it from Finder, however I wonder if there's a way we can retain the same functionality. I'll take a look.",
