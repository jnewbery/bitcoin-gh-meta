It shouldn't matter where the file comes from. You could have it shipped to you on a persistent storage medium.\r\n\r\nIt seems best to keep the download logic in separate scripts for each network (ipv4/6, torrent, tor, ipfs, ...). Also, if there is need to have it (in one script or multiple scripts), it could make more sense to have it in a separate repo?\r\n\r\n",
