It's just cumbersome and error prone.\r\n\r\nThe API we're adding in this PR makes this a simple and robust single operation (C++ API call or RPC call).\r\nIt's entirely opt-in and the user can decide to use it or not, up to their own judgement on how effective it is in improving their privacy. I would assume anyone using the C++/RPC interface understands the implications and can be trusted to know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nThe GUI PR (https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui/pull/733) implements automation on top of this API, which is also entirely opt-in. We provide an explanation of how it works, so the user could make an educated decision on whether to use it or not. \r\nA lot of new Bitcoin users (myself including), weren't aware early on that it's important to use new addresses when receiving BTC. Many exchanges also don't make it easy either (eg by requiring time-locked whitelisting etc).\r\nAs a result I suspect many users may wish to improve their privacy by \"deniabilizing\" their UTXOs after the fact.\r\nThis has been my main motivation to pursue creating this tool. I personally wanted to use it and I suspected others may appreciate it too. ",

However, you can look at this explanation from bitcoin privacy wiki to understand basics:\r\n\r\n_\"In a peeling chain, a single address begins with a relatively large amount of bitcoins. A smaller amount is then peeled off this larger amount, creating a transaction in which a small amount is transferred to one address, and the remainder is transferred to a one-time change address. This process is repeated - potentially for hundreds or thousands of hops - until the larger amount is pared down, at which point (in one usage) the amount remaining in the address might be aggregated with other such addresses to again yield a large amount in a single address, and the peeling process begins again[5].\"_\r\n\r\nhttps://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy",

      "body" : "Hi @ishaanam  and thank you for looking at my PR.\r\nI do agree the implementation can be improved and your feedback helps me greatly.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts regarding your concerns:\r\n1) I thought about this problem too and indeed spending deniabilized outputs is somewhat challenging. \r\nObviously, if the user just HODLs, or spends less than a deniabilized UTXO, then all is good. \r\nHowever if they spend larger amounts, more than one UTXOs would get picked up and that would reveal that they belong to the same user. \r\nI don't think this destroys the entire privacy gained from deniabilization, since in a regular \"spend\" transaction with no-reuse tag, would look similar to deniabilized transaction, and blockchain analysis would've probably assigned some probability that some UTXOs are change, and our spending would confirm those ... But yes, the larger the spend the more would be revealed, so it's not ideal. \r\nPerhaps we could augment the UTXO selection algorithm to be deniabilization-aware, and perhaps there's ways to pick UTXO that minimize the damage? I'm not sure what heuristic we should use for that, so I'm open to suggestions.\r\nAnother option would be to provide a user parameter for \"likely spendable size\", which we use in the chunking decision and make strictly bigger chunks if possible. There's already logic that avoids \"dust\" chunks so it won't be difficult to extend in that direction.\r\n\r\n2) Yes, the fingerprint concern is valid and unfortunate (and sadly I wasn't aware of it when I started this work). However it's also a pre-existing problem and while I do agree we should fix it, I'm hoping we could do this in a separate PR. Also I'm not yet knowledgable enough to tackle it, so if you guys want me to pursue a solution I could use some help.\r\n\r\n3) The reason for grouping UTXOs that share the same address is that (and correct me if I'm wrong) if we can spend one UTXO from a given address, then we have ownership of all UTXOs that share that address. In other words, we don't lose any privacy by deniabilizing the whole group. \r\nIn my limited experience, large amount of shared-address UTXOs tends to happen when transferring from an exchange (eg periodic buys) - often people don't update their withdrawal address, and many exchanges make it difficult to update (eg by requiring whitelisting and so on).\r\nThis grouping allows the deniabilization process to actually reduce the UTXO count if used for just few cycles.\r\nAt any rate, it would be trivial do disable the grouping if there's a flaw in this reasoning, or otherwise have it on a user toggle or some such.\r\n\r\n> Given this, Iâm unsure whether it would make sense for an implementation of something like this to be built directly into \r\nBitcoin Core\r\n\r\nI thought about if this could be implemented in some kind of a plugin, but as far as I know, there's no support for plugins yet?\r\nOriginally my PR was entirely in the GUI, since I wanted to avoid API changes, but @achow101 correctly pointed out it would be safer and easier to test the main functions as part of the wallet API, so that's why I split the PR into a core and GUI parts.\r\nIf there's a path to implement this in a more \"plugin\" way, I'd be interested to hear of course.\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback. I greatly appreciate it.",

But yes, the larger the spend the more would be revealed, so it's not ideal.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but if you spend a UTXO thatâs the change from the previous transaction with the output of the next, thatâs one thing. But if you spend an output with the change from fifteen transactions prior, you may heavily imply that all payments in between were also self-sends.\r\n\r\n> * Another option would be to provide a user parameter for \"likely spendable size\", which we use in the chunking decision and make strictly bigger chunks if possible.

It would e.g. be possible to pick from two otherwise similar inputs sets the one that creates a change output whose value is most different from other UTXOs already in the wallet. Otherwise, it is a bit difficult to predict what a âlikely spendable sizeâ is, since it depends on many different factors such as future exchange rate, and unknown future motivations for the user to create transactions. I would surmise that past transactions would only have a limited utility in predicting future spending sizes. In fact in my master-thesis, I explored a similar idea by attempting to always create change of a similar amount as the recipient output. Unfortunately, the resulting UTXO pool performed subpar.",
