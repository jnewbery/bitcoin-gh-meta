      "body" : "# V26.0 Testing Guide notes\r\n\r\nHey @m3dwards thanks for taking this on, the guide looks great so far! I didn't practically run through all the tests myself yet, but left a few tiny nits from a read-through below:\r\n\r\n## Compile Release Candidate\r\n\r\n> it is recommended that you compile with sqlite(--with-sqlite=yes), so make sure you have installed the sqlite3 dependency.\r\n\r\ndefault is `--with-sqlite=auto` which will pick up `sqlite3` if it's installed, so this isn't particularly required so long as the dep is installed. If sqlite wallets are needed/used in the guide then it probably still makes sense though, as with it configure should fail if it can't find sqlite3 alerting you in the process instead of silently continuing without it\r\n\r\n## RPC: add getprioritisedtransactions\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- The RPC prioritisetransaction allows you to \"prioritise\" a transaction in the mempool by treating it as if it had a higher fee than it actually does. This new RPC allows you to see which transactions have been prioritised and if they are in your mempool.\r\n+ The RPC prioritisetransaction allows miners to \"prioritise\" a transaction in their mempool for block assembly by treating it as if it had a higher fee than it actually does. This new RPC fetches prioritised transactions from the node's mempool.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Send a transaction to yourself with a 10 sat per vbyte fee\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet send \"{\\\"$ADDRESS\\\": 1}\" null \"unset\" 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust a general comment: it can be easier to use the `-named` flag, so this command (and others) could drop a few unneeded params and become:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli -rpcwallet=test-wallet -named send outputs=\"{\\\"$ADDRESS\\\": 1}\" fee_rate=10\r\n```\r\nedit: I see you have used named for some of the other commands, so nvm.\r\n\r\n## RPC: Importmempool\r\n\r\nImport the mempool\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ bcli importmempool /tmp/26-rc-test/regtest/mempool.dat.old\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess it's the same in practice, but you've use `/tmp/` here instead of `$DATA_DIR/regtest/mempool.dat.old`\r\n\r\n## V2 Transport - BIP 324\r\n\r\n```diff!\r\n- The `true` at end of the previous command instructs the addnode RPC to us V2 transport.\r\n+ The `true` at end of the previous command instructs the addnode RPC to use V2 transport.\r\n```",
