      "body" : "In case anyone is unsure, the --enable-lto option, as-is, does work, no broken binaries etc (and we use (thin) LTO in oss-fuzz).\n\nChanges 1 & 3 here don't affect the compiled binary. The compiler will eat any duplicate -flto flags; the change to the -Werror flag is correct, but also does not affect the compiled binary.\n\nPassing the flags through to libsecp is an improvement, and I'm pretty sure that wasn't done originally, because when the --enable-lto option was implemented, we didn't have a clean way to do it. SECP_CFLAGS didn't exist.\n\nThat being said, I'm not sure if this option is something we should actually maintain going forward. It's been a useful convenience for testing, but as LTO has matured, and more configurations/options have become available (thin,auto etc), I'm not sure it makes sense for us to have a usage like this. We could probably revert back to c(xx)flags and friends, for passing options through. \n\nExtending the current build option to account for all new/different LTO functionality probably doesn't make sense (that isn't being done here, but before we change things further I think this is worth considering).",
