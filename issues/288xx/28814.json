   "body" : "Explicitly specifying a symbolizer path has fixed the two issues outlined in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28147#issuecomment-1789703076. It's not completely clear to my why this needs to be explicitly specified in some environments, and not in others, while at the same time `llvm-symbolizer` is already in PATH, however, this has fixed the 2 issues (Fedora & Tumbleweed). My guess is something to do with symlinking, and tooling expecting unversioned/exactly named binaries?\r\n\r\nIn future, we might be able to use `LLVM_SYMBOLIZER_PATH` instead, however that isn't currently used consistently across LLVM, i.e it's checked for in the asan_symbolize script, but not in in the ubsan script, or from in compiler-rt.\r\n\r\nThe other change here adds `verbosity=2` to the `*SAN_OPTIONS`. This produces a few more lines of output, that have been useful when debugging. i.e:\r\n```bash\r\nUndefinedBehaviorSanitizer: reading suppressions file at /bitcoin/test/sanitizer_suppressions/ubsan\r\n...\r\n==7521==Using llvm-symbolizer at user-specified path:/usr/bin/llvm-symbolizer-17.0.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternative to #28804.",
