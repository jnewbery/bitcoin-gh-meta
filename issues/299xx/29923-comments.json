      "body" : "> Instead of Qt's dependencies, maybe we should wrap Qt itself this way? Or do C++ templates break that too much?\r\n\r\nThis is basically not possible with a C++ library. It is thanks to C's lack of name mangling and its straightforward linkage model that makes this possible. Also Qt has a ton of symbols compared to these libraries. And even if you narrow it down to only the used symbols, it's much harder to keep track of.\r\n\r\nConceptually, a few low-level X (or in the future, Wayland) and font libraries are much more likely to be on the user's system than a compatible version of Qt. That will only become worse with Qt 5 versus 6. This PR, as is, doesn't change the needed libraries, only how they're imported.",
