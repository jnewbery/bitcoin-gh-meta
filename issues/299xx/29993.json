This makes sense given the amount of I/O involved. It's definitely slower than the process of creating the snapshot.\r\n\r\nOn my AMD Ryzen 7950x machine the IBD reaches block 300,000 while the snapshot has only loaded 71.2% (where is triggers a cache flush). By the time 100% is loaded IBD is at 324,000. When the snapshot chainstate is saved IBD reaches 362,000.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nPause IBD until the snapshot is loaded and the snapshot chain is activated.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n1. Do nothing\r\n2. Keep IBD going but at low priority (how???)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
