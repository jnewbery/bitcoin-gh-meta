Make it clear that it was _not_ an example, i.e. nothing in this file is pre-filled for the user, unlike our old bitcoin.conf which did have an example config which was often outdated\r\n2. Make it easy to discover, to deter users from going to some third party for a bitcoin.conf generator (e.g. lopps website for example) or worse, getting a `bitcoin.conf` from \"someone on the internet\"\r\n\r\nFor 1, considering that we no longer provide an example config and it's fairly obvious when you open the file that it is a full config, I would prefer @laanwj 's suggestion of calling the file `bitcoin.conf.example` (I think all we would need to do then is update the docs where it prompts the user to copy the file to their datadir and mention it should be renamed to `bitcoin.conf`).\r\n\r\nNot really a fan of moving the file into a different directory, since I think that makes the discoverability of the file slightly worse (which makes 2 more of a concern for me).",
