   "body" : "The `-datacarrier` option is redundant, as disabling the relay and mining of transactions creating OP_RETURN outputs can be accomplished by setting `-datacarriersize=0`. Its removal was supported by several people in the discussion of [#27261](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261) (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1472404739, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1581058082) and implemented in [#28130](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28130), but that PR was rejected due to making other, more controversial changes.\r\n\r\nBeing a breaking change, this will of course need a release note. I'd recommend anyone concerned that they might accidentally start relaying and mining OP_RETURN transactions to proactively set `-datacarriersize=0` now.",
