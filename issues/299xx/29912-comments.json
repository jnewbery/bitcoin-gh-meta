(If there is, then that is a bug in Bitcoin Core, which should be fixed)\r\n\r\n> https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/\r\n\r\nThis example has many issues:\r\n\r\n* It is not machine readable\r\n* It does not indicate the version of Bitcoin Core that is documented\r\n* It is wrong and outdated. For example https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getrawtransaction.html#argument-2-verbose is wrong. The type should be `int`, not a `bool`. Also it is missing verbose=3.\r\n* It has all the problems that I mentioned in the original post.\r\n\r\n>  https://wbnns.github.io/bitcoin-dev-docs/reference/rpc/index.html\r\n\r\nThis is the same as above, just rendered differently.\r\n\r\n>  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/JSON-RPC-interface.md\r\n\r\nI am aware of the file, because I initially wrote it. It describes the concept of the interface, but it is not a specification.\r\n\r\n> https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/API_reference_%28JSON-RPC%29\r\n\r\nThis is a wiki page that lists some manually maintained software projects, so all of them have the issues I mentioned in the original post. I don't have the time right now to list all the bugs they have, but if you spend enough time you will find that they are either not a specification, or that they are unmaintained for years, or that they have implementation errors.\r\n\r\nEdit: If there is a single software project out there, which currently correctly and fully implements the RPC API in a type-safe manner, it would be interesting to see how they approached it. But I doubt there is one?",

I believe @laanwj commented on it.\r\n\r\nMuch of it is already there, just not exposed. The `RPCHelpMan`/`RPCResult` structure for `help` handling was intended to be a start of formalizing the API, and to have some form of introspection. E.g. types are already checked against the spec while testing. It could be extended to include other data that's needed.\r\n\r\nThe same data that's used for rendering help could be returned on the RPC in a raw, machine-readable structured format. Easiest would be to define our own format, but if there is a suitable standard format that will work for JSON-RPC that's of course preferable. I don't think there was at the time I looked into it, but who knows.",
