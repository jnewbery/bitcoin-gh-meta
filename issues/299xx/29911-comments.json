I found only 2 useful when I last tested:\r\n> \r\n> seed.bitcoin.sipa.be seed.bitcoin.wiz.biz\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the overall situation is that bad. [It looks like](https://21.ninja/dns-seeds/reachable-share/) at all times, at least two thirds of DNS seeds are returning ~70-99% reachable nodes.\r\n\r\n[Individual seeds/seeders have issues on occasion](https://21.ninja/dns-seeds/stale-share/), but that's not really a problem if they're fixed eventually.\r\n\r\nSince I'm monitoring the seeds anyway, I can set up some sort of alerting if that helps.",
