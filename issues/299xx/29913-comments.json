It would be nice if this was handled internally in chainman correctly.\r\n\r\nI did that initially (see #26260 - https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26260#issuecomment-1270121139) but.. conceptually, all what is inside `reconsiderblock` seems to be at the wrong place for me too. We are resetting a block index flag at the RPC level. Ideally, we should encapsulate all this code within chainman too.\r\n\r\nAlso, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26260#pullrequestreview-1132786161 for the places where we set this field. We either set it when a new block is received, during startup or manually inside `invalidateblock()`. Thus why I think that setting it inside `reconsiderblock` is also \"fine\" (it is what we are already doing for its counterpart anyway).\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm also ok going with [52f5d62](https://github.com/furszy/bitcoin-core/commit/52f5d62957ad0d9e2b2c8d00333a369fb4a369c7) if that gets more traction too. Both options fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n> Also, given that cs_main is held only for this line, a race exits, where the getchainstates RPC is called before this line, and still returns the wrong result.\r\n\r\nTrue. But, as RPC calls are blocking and this RPC command is usually a one-time only not critical call, I think that it is a harmful race.",
