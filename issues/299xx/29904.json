   "body" : "Removing dependencies is a general goal of the project and the xz backdoor has been an additional wake up call recently. Libevent shows many of the same symptoms, few maintainers and slow releases. While libevent can not be removed completely over night we should start removing itâs usage where it's possible, ideally with the end goal to removing it completely.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty easy win in that direction. The [`evhttp_uridecode` function from libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/e0a4574ba2cbcdb64bb2b593e72be7f7f4010746/http.c#L3542) we were using in `urlDecode` could be easily emulated in fewer LOC. This also ports the [applicable test vectors over from libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/master/test/regress_http.c#L3430).",
