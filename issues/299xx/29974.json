If the flag is unset, upon selecting an outpoint as input for a new transaction, the input is popped to prevent re-selection and later re-added to the collection (once all inputs have been picked). However, the re-addition to the collection is performed independently of whether the flag was set or not. This means that, if the flag is set, the selected inputs are duplicated which in turn makes these inputs more likely to be re-picked in the following iteration of the loop.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, both the input and output count of the transaction and bonded to the number of available outpoints. This makes sense for the former, but the latter shouldn't be.",
