I might try it out with the RO mount soon and see if it works OK that way or if there's anything else trying to make changes to the FS.\r\n\r\nI don't want to derail this issue, but in a somewhat-related changeset I was also wondering if I could _speed up_ the linter image build (with better layer caching) by building from the python base image and absorbing the install script into the image (as part of a general python revamp in [this branch](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/compare/master...willcl-ark:bitcoin:fixup-lint-docker-image)).\r\n\r\nI'd be curious what you thought of this approach @maflcko (perhaps I should open another issue to discuss it?) ISTM that without the install script, and with the introduction of `requirements-lint.txt` developers would generally be able to run the local linter (`pip install -r requirements-lint.txt && cd test/lint/test_runner && cargo run ...`) more easily, and the container can build can be sped up quite significantly. What I'm not sure of is if the script has other purposes which this would interfere with...\r\n\r\nNB: the CI stuff in that branch is broken/WIP, and I'm not convinced in any benefit to merging `.style.yapf` into a potential `pyproject.toml`.",
