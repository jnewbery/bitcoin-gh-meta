The issue does not happen on my Ubuntu machines and it seems to only be happening with my Windows based machines.\r\n\r\nHave tried opening this ticket many times now but my logs never fit. Can provide them but they provide nothing of note anyways as the client crashes and Windows closes Core before it can write to the log the issue, but the issue seems QT driven so I'm not sure it would even show up in the log anyways.\r\n\r\nIssue seems to happen the most when banning bad behaving peers manually.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nTo be able to right click and ban known bad acting peers without a crash.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRight click on a bad actor peer and ban them, immediate lockup across MULTIPLE systems and both Windows 10 and Windows 11.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\nCan include in a comment as each time I have tried to make this issue (more than ten times now) I am unable to include the log because it exceeds the comment length.\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nOther\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv27 both pre-built and manually compiled, same issue.\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nWindows 10 and Windows 11\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
