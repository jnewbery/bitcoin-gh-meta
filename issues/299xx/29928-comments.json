This ensures that each issue is thoroughly investigated and resolved based on its own merits, rather than being bundled together or deferred due to perceived similarities. The forums you've referenced are predominantly for general Bitcoin inquiries akin to StackOverflow discussions. However, my intent is not to pose a question but rather to report a glaring code flaw (See BIP42).\r\n\r\nAddressing bugs only when they become operationally critical may not be the most prudent approach. In software development, especially in a system as foundational as Bitcoin, proactive bug resolution is key to maintaining trust and reliability.\r\n\r\nWhile I could initiate a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) or submit a Pull Request (PR), I must admit that I lack the necessary Bitcoin expertise and time to adequately address the issue across the entire affected codebase. Therefore, I am deferring to you and the rest of the Bitcoin developer community, who possess the required skills and resources to devise the best solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nThe generational issue I mentioned serves to highlight the problem and the clear limitations within Bitcoin's code due to the use of small data types. It is not intended to be a serious proposal, but rather, it is an example of a broader concern. I also do not suggest that an issue should be opened for every instance where block height might overflow, nor do I expect Bitcoin code reviewers to do so. Simply identifying and documenting the problem along with the affected code areas for future consideration should suffice.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the arguments presented seem more like a pretext to diminish the visibility of the issue, rather than confronting it directly.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nKino",

I said that fixing an issue in a code base that is expected to stop working in 2106, for an issue that is expected to happen in thousands of years is useless at best. In practice, a fix now would most likely result in a increased runtime load  or increased memory load, along with the risk of a consensus and chain split. Also, the C++ language is evolving rapidly right now, so any fix today could very well turn out entirely unused or suboptimal. Also, Bitcoin Core is evolving as a software project, so it is possible that a fix will happen as a side-effect of another future change \"for free\".\r\n\r\nIn any case, this issue is well-known, obvious and trivial to re-dicscover. If there is interest to fix the issue, or if an acceptable solution is found, it will be proposed. There is no need to keep this tracking issue open. In fact, leaving this open will just serve as a distraction from real issues that are happening to users today.",
