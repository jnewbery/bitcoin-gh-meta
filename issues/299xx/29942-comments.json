I'd recommend anyone concerned that they might accidentally start relaying and mining OP_RETURN transactions to proactively set `-datacarriersize=0` now.\r\n\r\nNot sure about saving 4 lines of code for a breaking change. There are other redundant options such as `-signet` and `-chain=signet`, so I don't see why this one should be removed?\r\n\r\n(Edit: I know I changed my opinion on this, compared to https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27261#issuecomment-1581058082, but I think it is clear that some users may be using this option and saving a few lines of code may not be worth it in the end, considering this is a breaking change. However, flattening the optional can still be done, because it is not a breaking change and comes with most of the benefits of what this pull is trying to achieve?)",
