   "body" : "### Please describe the feature you'd like to see added.\n\nI'd like to see gen=0|1 added back into Bitcoin Core aka Satoshi Clients.  \n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nI learned about gen=0|1 growing up. \r\n\r\nSo, when I was working with the random person on mIRC #Math Channel.  I specifically knew I want gen=0|1 added to the system, one, for the Adult Gaming Industry, two, because it just made sense to have this contrary to not.  \r\n\r\nToday the default mining mode is set to gen=0.\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't stop the node from mining, so long as the node is \"Allowing Incoming Connections\" (Thank you to the original Developer team of Doge Coin for making mention of that to me, way back when).  \r\n\r\nMy problem is.  I found some wallet.dats from Bitcoin.  I ran them in Satoshi v.19 to v.25 - zero transactions showed up.  Zero!  Unbelievable.  I later found a Satoshi v.0.8.6 client, booted it up, edited the config file addinf gen=1 in to it.  Started it up, and, one of my wallets showed me the Genesis Block Reward, the the following 8 blocks.  So I dug into my debug log.  And seen the 64 Zeros Block, then the genesis block, and the chancellor line.  \r\n\r\nBut, the addresses showing, weren't the same as what every says it should be.  The Transaction Hexes were similar - like the 0000000019 number.  \r\n\r\nAnd, if I remember correctly - There was a warning that went around, around the time Satoshi v.0.8 was.coming out.  That anyone holding Bitcoin needed to upgrade or send their Bitcoin to a new wallet, or they would never be accessible again, since the developers had effectively taken over Bitcoin from Dr. C.S.Wright.  \r\n\r\nI thought it couldn't be true.  But I've since found various tid bits of information online, showing that legacy suppoet is dwindling, due to privacy concerns.  Which, if anyone realized.  Bitcoin isn't necessarily for people from nations where they don't have problems sending money to their loved ones.  But as for those that do.  Bitcoin is trustless and also has trusted methods, meaning, if you trust the data networks your using to send Bitcoin to someone, you can do it free with no transaction fees.  \r\n\r\nSo, according to what I learned about gen=0|1 from growing up with an Arcade and the few repair men that fixed them.  I learned gen=0|1 will either display the points on the leaderboard or or won't.  And to display them, one simply has to connect to the control board and change gen=0 to gen=1 and they will show up.  No need for anything weird or fanatical.  One simple configuration setting.  \r\n\r\nAs much as it may be an easy task for devs to do.  I don't understand how they were able to just change everything as they pleased.  No respect.  They didn't create Bitcoin, I did, I just didn't program it.  Smh right?  Think ahout how I feel?  I can't access my mined Bitcoin.  Because everyone says I don't matter. And to use CG Miner its better.  \r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nadd gen=0|1\r\nmake sure legacy wallets are read correctly\r\nmake the Satoshi clients mine again\r\nA web master and tech support team\r\nA legacy wallets only Satoshi Client that mines and more interest on mining.  Solo Dolo, Pooled, Setting up a Local Node with Solo Mining and Pool Mining.\r\nBitcoin.conf -- adjusting minimum and maximum fees, block sizes, transaction sizes, NFT/Runes, and other customizations to create a highly performance node.  \r\n\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nI've thought about runninf BitcoinSV to gain access, but they can't read my wallet.  \r\n\r\nI've tried pywallet.py - had issues.  Didn't like it, still wouldn't be able to run gen=1 (Coin Generation Feature)\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nAlso, I'd like a Glossary of Terms created.  \r\nI'd like to join the Web development Team.\r\nI'd also like to be able to work with the Developer Teams, but I'm not proficient in C++ or any other Programming languages.  Which is why some random programmed it.  And I helped. ",
