If there actually is no data and we want to setup generation, then that should also occur in a constructor rather than afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis change is only applied to DescriptorScriptPubKeyMan and ExternalSignerScriptPubKeyMan, and should be done for any ScriptPubKeyMans added in the future. I don't think it's really worth it to do this for LegacyScriptPubKeyMan since it would make loading performance worse (or cause layer violations) and it's (supposed to be) going away soon.",
