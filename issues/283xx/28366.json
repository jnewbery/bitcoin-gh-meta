   "body" : "PR #26152 moved waste calculation into SelectionResult to be able to correct the waste score on basis of the bump_fee_group_discount for overlapping ancestries. This left two functions with largely overlapping purpose, where one was simply a wrapper of the other. This PR cleans up the overlap, and fixes the double-meaning of `change_cost` where the `GetChange()` function assumed that no change was created when `change_cost` was set to 0. This behavior was exploited in a bunch of tests, but is problematic, because a `change_cost` of 0 is permitted with custom settings for feerate and discard_feerate (i.e. when theyâre both 0).",
