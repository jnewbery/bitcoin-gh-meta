I've changed all the refs in functional tests  (18 files) and `test_node.py` had some methods where I think it also makes sense to pass Path object instead of datadir str so that `os.path.join` can be avoided in those places as well. All functional tests passed on my local.\r\n\r\nIf ok by you guys, I can spend sometime on replacing os.path refs in the next commit.",
