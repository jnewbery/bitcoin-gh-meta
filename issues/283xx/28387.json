Currently if you want to use the console of Bitcoin-Qt you would need to close this out and then use `bitcoin-cli` separately to mine blocks.\r\n\r\nWhen running Bitcoin-Qt in regtest mode it's clear by seeing a blue Bitcoin logo instead of the orange one.\r\n<img width=\"75\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-01 at 6 23 34 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/7761473/d792ef8c-9078-4132-ab19-71af9ac6bf18\">\r\nHowever, there is no way to thoroughly test some capabilities without having the ability to mine blocks. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nBitcoin-Qt is able to use `generate` or `-generate` flag similar to what `bitcoin-cli` can do.\r\n\r\nCurrently if you run `generate` the response is:\r\n```\r\nhas been replaced by the -generate cli option. Refer to -help for more information.\r\n (code -1)\r\n```\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\nHaving bitcoin-cli shipped with all binaries on bitcoincore.org.\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\nlow priority",
