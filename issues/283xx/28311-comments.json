Per @luke-jr's [request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28311#issue-1860387785):\r\n\r\n> Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums... not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs, just Approach ACKs / constructive criticism.\r\n\r\nIn case this request was missed, or there was a misunderstanding about the request, by \"just Approach ACK / constructive criticism\" Luke is saying he only wants feedback on his specific _approach_ taken to implement BIP300 in this PR. If a reviewer likes this approach, or does not like this approach and can suggest a better approach to implementing the BIP300 spec, then that is the kind of feedback Luke is looking for. On the other hand, if a reviewer has feedback about the _general concept_ of BIP300 then Luke requests that that feedback be shared elsewhere -- may I suggest the [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev) mailing list or the new [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org) forum?",

      "body" : "@luke-jr @petertodd As someone that can claim to be your technical peer and with experience in consensus development, I would appreciate if you can publish on the communication space of your convenience the contractual commitment excerpts linking your work on drivechain to the proposal authors themselves . The amount and all personal matters are no public business, though at the very least I hope you have minimal provisions protecting the autonomy of your creative work or ensuring the intellectual outcome respect FOSS licenses.\r\n\r\nWith all my respect, Iâm not questioning the legitimacy as an independent technical expert who has accumulated years of hard works of being paid to offer a grounded and in-depth technical opinion on a subject in the scope of its competence. Here Iâm just asking for transparency on potential conflict of interest that one would request in all walk of life (law, health, energy) when experts are expressing themselves on a complex subject with potential large-scale and serious impact on the end-users (financial) life.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have the competence and knowledge to evaluate the proposal both in code and its associated documentation without relying on âdomain expertsâ, though I think other folks in the community would appreciate the ethical effort. \r\n\r\nI understand itâs delicate as a remark though as Rusty Russell [observed](https://rusty-lightning.medium.com/the-corrosion-of-ethics-in-cryptocurrencies-f7ba77e9dfc3) a while back in matters of open-source cryptocurrency development ethics, weâre keeping each other in check as peers. Iâve been in the same situation early last year when Iâve been approached to do a paid security review of the CTV soft-fork and I politely declined. My professional policy for years have been to decline any work commitment related to consensus changes to preserve the independence of my views.\r\n\r\nIf you would like feedback on how to construct ethically and legally such agreement, Iâm staying available out of band to provide my viewpoint and relevant information. I donât think the discussion is appropriate for the GH repository. Iâm staying available to discuss the ethics and ideal development process of consensus changes on the mailing list or other forum of discussions. As a community, I think weâre still paying the trauma of a group of Bitcoin dev experts raising millions in VC-funding almost a decade ago to promise new technology and corresponding consensus changes and finding themselves in a massive situation of conflict of interests with the rest of the ecosystem, whatever the great achievements they have realized on a lot of significant fronts.",

      "body" : "> This is a (rough draft) clean rewrite of BIP300 (Drivechain) consensus-level code.\r\n> \r\n> Instead of a separate sidechain database (which may be prone to hard-to-review/test consistency issues), instead the unusable 8 MSB of the UTXO index are reserved for non-UTXO database entries, and the existing UTXO db and caching layer is shared. This can be refactored in the future, but I think it is the cleanest and most reviewable approach initially - open to other ideas, though. There's also some ugliness in the undo data to handle restoring the new data, but it's abstracted and shouldn't be too hard to reason about.\r\n> \r\n> Using these new primitives, Drivechains can be reimplemented with a UTXO-like model. Note that there is zero activation logic in the current PR: the protocol changes are _always_ active. Therefore, this will _not_ work (at least not safely) on Bitcoin today, and cannot be deployed without significant additional changes to handle an activation.\r\n> \r\n> A new `SERIALIZE_TRANSACTION_FOR_WEIGHT` serialization flag is also added, that is meant only for weight counting. This allows for adjusting weight (upward) to fit additional resource requirements by new functionality. In this case, several Drivechain \"messages\" are expected to have a larger burden than their `OP_RETURN` encoding would otherwise weigh. However, the specific adjustments are not implemented in this draft.\r\n> \r\n> As a consensus change, this can only be implemented with community support. Many people seem to have opinions, but please keep them to other forums. Despite providing and continuing this implementation, I myself do not thereby endorse or otherwise comment on the proposal itself.\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, not looking for concept ACKs/NACKs (ie, about Drivechains), just _Approach_ ACKs / constructive criticism (ie, about _how_ I'm implementing it).\r\n\r\nNACK, concept, approach, all. IMV Bitcoin is NOT made for the BIP/PR mania, Core Devs profit absolutely from. Any Core Devs, are by definition, not the ones to decide anything due to lack of exemption as service providers in Bitcoin, not unbiased customers/node operators(the only unbiased who must decide about their OWN property). It is for long been that Devs keep pushing node operators out of the decisions that belong solely to them as owners of Bitcoin, NOT to Devs, NOT to miners. Instead of coding every time an OPTION in full nodes software to allow (UN)SUPPORT for each non-stop new BIP/PR mania non-bug fixing CHANGE to Bitcoin, they discretely discuss things in a 'only for the experts central Hub' environment, like this one in GitHub and less user friendly, MS-DOS/command prompt like and as geeky as possible, JUST LIKE ALTCOINERS DID when inventing a lot of weird new jargon for things that always existed, so that all the idiots could eat their very shady technical jargon in speculative marvel and fiat dollar signs in their eyes.",

Everything else is off-topic.\r\n\r\nThere is an uncertainty on the open-source status of the technical contributions due to the apparent mode of financial compensation of the \"champions\" developers, among other issues. While this might be acceptable for a lot of contributions in other areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem, here we're talking about consensus changes in a $500B ecosystem, any exposure due to uncertain license on key components might taint the rest of the open-source Bitcoin software. I think we've already enough issues with CSW lawsuits from now on to minimize the legal exposure of all ecosystem stakeholders, in my reasonable opinion.\r\n\r\nThis type of discussion happens, among other forums, on the Github repository. E.g #28175.\r\n\r\n> Any skeptics or opponents of DC should at least pretend to want to see a real implementation, before dismissing it. After all, pre-implementation the idea is inherently unfinished.\r\n\r\nI've never seen any Bitcoin Core commit or substantial review on delicate critical components realized under your pseudonym, or even substantial technical contributions on deployed and with real-world usage multi-party applications or contracting protocols (e.g payment channels), so I don't know your level of understanding of the Bitcoin network, protocols architecture and ecosystem. Even when an idea is fully fleshed out in code and once it deployed you have unmeasurable security, safety and compatibility maintenance costs beared by the whole ecosystem ad vitam aeternam (i.e\r\nas long as Bitcoin is around for the next decaces/centuries hopefully). Additionally, it also increases the development cost on all the affected Bitcoin systems: miner stack, mempool and transaction-relay, lightning, vaults, data carriage cost as investigating for the lack or the finding of potentially harmful interactions due to modified miner incentives is a very high technical bar.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't have strong technical opinion on DC / sidechains, as with any complex technical matter this is far from being a \"binary\" subject. All I know is we're Aug 30 (depending your timezone) and there is far enough hard technical issues to review and test for the coming year (package relay, assumeutxo, libitcoinkernel, bip324, _maybe maybe_ APO, transaction-relay policy improvement for data carriage usage). Speaking for myself and myself only, this is not worthy to allocate high-caliber technical review time (in a pure FOSS fashion without financial compensation to preserve independence of my judgement) on a consensus changes project with that level of uncertainty in its development process, at the very least until next year Aug 30 2024. By then, I hope project champions will have clarified the development and technical evaluation process of DC.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to discuss in depth the ethics of Bitcoin consensus changes, what lessons can be sketched out from the failed activation of CTV by its champion Jeremy Rubin last year or the best development practices of critical Bitcoin components, I'm staying available to discuss it during in person at a panel or another public format at a Bitcoin conference during the coming years.",
