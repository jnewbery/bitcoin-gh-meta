If a reviewer likes this approach, or does not like this approach and can suggest a better approach to implementing the BIP300 spec, then that is the kind of feedback Luke is looking for. On the other hand, if a reviewer has feedback about the _general concept_ of BIP300 then Luke requests that that feedback be shared elsewhere -- may I suggest the [bitcoin-dev](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev) mailing list or the new [Delving Bitcoin](https://delvingbitcoin.org) forum?",

We need to be laser focused (no pun intended) on scaling bitcoins utxo p2p money utility, and while the idea of a 2way peg sidechains using hash rate escrow via `bip300` is one such solution, (in addition to larger block size,` bip119` and other covenants), the abstract bling merged mining in `bip301`, opens bitcoin incentives to things other than p2p money bitcoin. \r\n\r\nthe solution here is to \"_limit_\" sidechains to the p2p money utility. this will keep miner incentives as is, and scale bitcoin with bitcoin script. such a solution can be achieved, but first requires this explicit social consensus intent and explicit designer and implementor intent. \r\n\r\nwith such intent in place, the miners _Nash_ equilibrium is to follow intent, due to the implied `UASF` which already implicitly secures `bip300` in the first place.
