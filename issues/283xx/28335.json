   "body" : "Similarly to #28327 I wanted to open this PR to receive some opinions and better approaches.\r\n\r\nThe kernel library is currently at the stage where unwanted headers are removed from its set of headers. In practice, this means we are reducing the number of includes that are required for compiling the experimental `bitcoin-chainstate` binary. This is described in stage 1 step 3 of the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).\r\n\r\nCurrently the mempool is part of the kernel library. The mempool headers include the boost multi index headers. Thus any application wanting to use the kernel library and its headers will have to include the boost headers too. This is not only undesirable because of the sheer size of these headers, but also might lead to conflicts if the including application uses a different boost version.\r\n\r\nIn the approach laid out by this PR, mempool member variables and methods are declared in the header without having to include boost by either wrapping them in a struct and [pimpling](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) them, or making methods static implementation functions. The boost definitions are gathered into separate header (`mempool_set_definitions.h`) that is only included by implementation files that require definitions of the boost types. This allows us to retain the current architecture with roughly the same interfaces. \r\n\r\nThe approach laid out by this PR also has some, albeit small, compilation speed and size benefits. Averaged over a few of compilation runs I consistently observe faster compilation by a couple of seconds and some smaller pre-processed and compiled object sizes. The main detractor of this method is obviously the number of lines touched. However it also has the benefit of inventorizing all the files that require direct access to the mempool data structures as well getting rid of boost multi index includes in non-kernel implementation files that include the mempool, but don't directly manipulate its data structures (e.g. wallet.cpp).\r\n\r\nA much simpler alternative approach, at least on the surface, would be removing all `txmempool.h` includes from kernel library headers (see [this branch](https://github.com/TheCharlatan/bitcoin/tree/mempoolBoostSimple)). Currently this is only `validation.h`.  Due to the mutex member of `CTxMemPool` and the correspondingly defined lock decorators on the chainstate methods this becomes a bit more complicated though and I am not sure how this might be possible with the current architecture.\r\n\r\nA discussion of how and if to remove the mempool from the kernel library has so far been intentionally punted to the next stage of the kernel library development. Pimpling the mempool itself precludes this discussion, since the library could never be shipped with the `CTxMemPool` headers. Pimpling the mempool members (like done in this PR) might also make a future splitting of block and mempool validation logic into separate compilation units easier.",
