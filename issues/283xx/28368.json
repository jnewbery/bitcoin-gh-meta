   "body" : "This is an attempt to  #11775 \r\n\r\nThis Pr will enable fee estimator to listen to ValidationInterface notifications to process new transactions added and removed from the mempool.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Added a new callback to the Validation Interface `MempoolBlockConnect`, which notifies listeners about the transactions that have been removed due to a new block being connected, along with the height at which the block was removed.\r\n- Modified the `TransactionAddedToMempool` callback parameter to include additional information about the transaction needed for fee estimation.\r\n- Updated `CBlockPolicyEstimator` to process transactions using` CTransactionRef` instead of `CTxMempoolEntry.`\r\n- Implemented the `CValidationInterface` interface in `CBlockPolicyEstimater` and overridden the `TransactionAddedToMempool`, `TransactionRemovedFromMempool`, and `MempoolBlockConnect` methods to receive updates from their notifications.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the fee estimator updates from the mempool. When a new block was connected, all transactions in the block that were present in our mempool were removed using the `removeForBlock` function in `txmempool.cpp`. \r\n\r\nThis removal triggered updates to the fee estimator. As a result, the fee estimator would block mempool's `cs` until it finished updating every time a new block was connected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is smaller in terms of the changes made compared to #11775, as it focuses solely on enabling fee estimator updates from the validationInterface/cscheduler thread notifications.\r\n\r\nI have not split the validation interface because, as I understand it, the rationale behind the split in #11775 was to have `MempoolInterface` signals come from the mempool and `CValidationInterface` events come from validation. I believe this separation can be achieved in a separate refactoring PR when the need arises.\r\n\r\nAlso left out some commits from #11775\r\n- Some refactoring which are no longer needed.\r\n- Handle reorgs much better in fee estimator. \r\n- Track witness hash malleation in fee estimator \r\n\r\nI believe they are a separate change that can come in a follow-up after this.\r\n\r\nLeaving this in a draft while seeking Concept and Approach ACK.\r\n",
