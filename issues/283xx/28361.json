   "body" : "In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122 , we add a `PubKeyDestination` and a `V0SilentPaymentsDestination`. Both of these PRs update `fuzz/util.cpp` and need a way to create well-formed pubkeys. Currently in `fuzz/util.cpp`, we have some logic for creating pubkeys in the multisig data provider. This logic is duplicated in #28246 and duplicated again in #28122. Seems much better to have a `ConstructPubKeyBytes` function that both PRs (and any future work) can reuse.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a function to do this and has the existing code use it. While the purpose is to introduce a utility function, the previous multisig code used `ConsumeIntegralInRange(4, 7)` which would have created some uncompressed pubkeys with the prefix 0x05, which is incorrect (see https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57855/c-secp256k1-what-do-prefixes-0x06-and-0x07-in-an-uncompressed-public-key-signif)\r\n\r\ntldr; using `PickValueFromArray` is more correct as it limits to the set of defined prefixes for compressed and uncompressed pubkeys.",
