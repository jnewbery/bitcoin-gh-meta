   "body" : "In https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28246 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28122 , we add a `PubKeyDestination` and a `V0SilentPaymentsDestination`. Both of these PRs update `fuzz/util.cpp` and need a way to create well-formed pubkeys. Currently in `fuzz/util.cpp`, we have some logic for creating pubkeys in the multisig data provider. This logic is duplicated in #28246 and duplicated again in #28122. Seems much better to have a `ConsumePubKey` function that both PRs (and any future work) can reuse.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a function to do this and reactors the existing code to use it. While this is a refactor, the previous multisig code used to only create uncompressed public keys using `{0x04, 0x07}`, but this new function creates them using `{0x04, 0x06, 0x07}`, which is _technically_ a behavior change. `0x06` and `0x07` represent the hybrid pubkey format (see https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/57855/c-secp256k1-what-do-prefixes-0x06-and-0x07-in-an-uncompressed-public-key-signif), which we already support, since we were already using `0x07`. \r\n\r\ntldr; adding `0x06` improves our fuzz test coverage, but I wanted to call it out for reviewers since this is a small behavior change that is not currently tested for in our current fuzzing corpus since all of the current corpus was generated with the old code.",
