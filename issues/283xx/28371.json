And it appears this is detectable too, as our own `mempoolminfee` would be lower.\r\n\r\nWhile obviously relay can't be guaranteed, this is a detectable situation, and it could factor into the outbound replacement logic and/or trigger something similar to the \"seek more peers\" behavior we exhibit when we appear to be not getting blocks.\r\n",
