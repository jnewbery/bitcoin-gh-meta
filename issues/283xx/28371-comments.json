It seems useful in general, would solve this situation for transactions with a reasonable fee attached, and for transactions with a fee such as it would be under 60MB of unconfirmed transactions.. it's the application's responsibility to prevent this?\r\n\r\nI understand for Lightning's commitment transactions you rely on your peer to cosign a feerate update, but you would most likely have dropped to chain before getting in a situation where you are holding a commit tx whose feerate is lower than that of 60MB worth of unconfirmed transactions?\r\n\r\nWe should probably check what the node-in-a-box projects set as `-maxmempool` too.",
