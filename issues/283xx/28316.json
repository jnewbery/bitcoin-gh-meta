Wait a few blocks or enable -fallbackfee.\r\n```\r\n\r\nis helpful, because if you aren't able to set a fee based on an external source or the internal fee estimation code, then you're likely to either waste money when the default is too high, or have a tx that won't confirm if the default is too low. On regtest and friends it's not help, and the advice may well be wrong: particularly on regtest, mining additional empty blocks won't help at all.\r\n\r\nBut for test net's there is an easy default available that is quite reliable: just use the minimum tx fee.",
