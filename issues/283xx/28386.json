   "body" : "Fixes #28290\r\n\r\nThese fixed timeouts aren't affected by the `timeout_factor` option and can therefore cause timeouts in slow environments.\r\nThey are also unnecessary for the test because they measure the wrong thing:\r\nWhile there is an internal waiting time of 60s within `ThreadOpenConnections` (beginning only when that thread is started) for fixed seeds querying, the timeouts here don't measure that but the time from startup until a debug log message is encountered, during which many other things happen in init, so they don't make much sense to me in the first place.",
