Create a shallow clone instead with history truncated to the one commit of the version tag, which is directly checked out in the same command. This has the nice side-effect that we can remove the extra `git checkout` step after as it's not needed anymore.\r\n\r\nNote that it might look confusing to pass a _tag_ to a parameter named `--branch`, but the git-clone manpage explicitly states that this is supported.",
