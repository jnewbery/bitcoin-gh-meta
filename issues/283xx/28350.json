   "body" : "While doing manual testing on assumeutxo this week I managed to put the coindb into an inconsistent state twice. For a normal user, this can also happen if their computer crashes during a flush or if they try to stop their node during a flush and then get tired of waiting and just shut their computer down or kill the process. It's an edge case but I wouldn't be surprised if this does happen more often when assumeutxo gets used more widely because there might be multiple flushes happening during loading of the UTXO set in the beginning and users may think something is going wrong because of the unexpected wait or they forgot some configs and want to start over quickly. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, when this happens at first the node starts up normally until it's time to flush again and then it hits an assert that the user can not understand.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-08-25T16:31:09Z [httpworker.0] [snapshot] 52000000 coins loaded (43.30%, 6768 MB)\r\n2023-08-25T16:31:16Z [httpworker.0] Cache size (7272532192) exceeds total space (7256510300)\r\n2023-08-25T16:31:16Z [httpworker.0] FlushSnapshotToDisk: flushing coins cache (7272 MB) started\r\nAssertion failed: (old_heads[0] == hashBlock), function BatchWrite, file txdb.cpp, line 126.\r\nAbort trap: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should at least log an error message that gives users a hint of what the problem is and what they can do to resolve it. I am keeping this separate from the assumeutxo project since this issue can also happen during any regular flush.",
