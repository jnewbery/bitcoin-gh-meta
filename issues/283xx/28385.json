   "body" : "Motivation\r\n- I think it's preferable to use stdlib data structures instead of depending on boost if we can achieve the same thing.\r\n- Also see #28335 for further context/motivation. This PR simplifies that one.\r\n\r\nThings done in this PR:\r\n- Add a bench for `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` where we reorg and the new chain has {100%, 90%, 10%} of the same transactions. AFAIU in practice, it's usually close to 100%.\r\n- Rewrite `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` as a `std::list` + `unordered_map` instead of a boost multi index container.\r\n  - On my machine, the bench suggests the performance is very similar.\r\n- Move `DisconnectedBlockTransactions` from txmempool.h to its own kernel/disconnected_transactions.h. This struct isn't used by txmempool and doesn't have much to do with txmempool. My guess is that it's been living there for convenience since the boost includes are there.\r\n",
