Note that this effectively reverts #25306.\r\n\r\nIt should be compatible with other in-progress PRs -- it only deprecates the `LogPrint*` functions, it doesn't break them. And it should be easy to finish the conversion with a scripted-diff replacing LogPrintf/LogPrint across the codebase.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a straightforward way of getting the logging stuff finished up.\r\n\r\ncc @jonatack ",

But no reason it can't be reviewed now. It could also be split up to separate out the `-loglevel` vs `-trace` change, or to defer the `map` to `atomic` change -- ie, I guess if later commits don't feel worth the review effort, feel free to stop early?",
