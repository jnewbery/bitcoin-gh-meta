This can easily lead to OOM, as you explain, in which case the user would have to start from zero, because potentially nothing has been persisted at all. Also, for slow storage it could lead to hangs, which could lead the user (or OS) to kill the process, causing the same issues. Finally, with assumeutxo, I wonder why there is any need to chase this? No objection to this pull, but I wonder if this really makes users happier *on average*, or will just lead to more hangs, crashes and `-reindex`.",
