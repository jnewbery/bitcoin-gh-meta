      "body" : "Added a commit to ensure that the mempool is at least enforcing the script rules that will be required for the next block. Not sure that's sensible: it only makes a difference if there's a rule in `GetBlockScriptFlags` that's not in `MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS`, and if there is such a rule, even with this patch, you could add a tx to the mempool prior to the rule becoming active, in which case it wouldn't magically be removed from the mempool when it became active. There's already a double check in the mining code (`test_block_validity`) which would prevent PoW being wasted on a block that included an invalid tx because it was somehow made it into the mempool.",
