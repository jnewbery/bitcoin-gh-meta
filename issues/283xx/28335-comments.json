It removes our _last_ external dependency. That's a huge achievement imo. Barring us vendoring Boost, it's the difference between: \"take this lib and build a hello world app in your point-and-click IDE\" to \"use this docker image which includes our recommended version of boost headers to build from a script\". I know, I know, the latter is an exaggeration and wouldn't be the end of the world. But without boost, as-is right now, we'd be able to ship a libbitcoinkernel that depends on only [these headers](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/60da4fa6190e3a85d094f97dc8e578aeabcd22bf#diff-4cb884d03ebb901069e4ee5de5d02538c40dd9b39919c615d8eaa9d364bbbd77R1002-R1096) (though obviously paring down that list is a next step) and nothing from the outside world. To me that's very significant.\r\n\r\n> But despite the large diff and long description, the changes in the PR do seem pretty straightforward, so I don't think the benefits need to be that big to justify the changes.\r\n\r\n+1 though as stated above, to me the benefits _are_ that big :)",
