(I doubt there are a lot of applications that would opt for using multiple versions of boost in the same build, and if there are it would seem more straightforward for them to put an #include boundary between their application code and libbitcoin_kernel than would be is for this PR to put a boundary between mempool code and the rest of the kernel.)\r\n\r\nBut despite the large diff and long description, the changes in the PR do seem pretty straightforward, so I don't think the benefits need to be that big to justify the changes.",
