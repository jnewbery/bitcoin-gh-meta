   "body" : "Fixing https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28250#issuecomment-1674830104 and more.\r\n\r\nCurrently, redeem scripts longer than 520 bytes, which are technically valid under segwit rules, have flaws in the following processes:\r\n1) The multisig creation process fails to deduce the output descriptor, resulting in the generation of an incorrect descriptor. Additionally, the accompanying user warning is also inaccurate.\r\n2) The `signrawtransactionwithkey` RPC command fail to sign them.\r\n3) The legacy wallet `addmultisigaddress` wrongly discards them.\r\n\r\nThe issue arises because most of these flows are utilizing the legacy spkm keystore, which imposes\r\nthe [p2sh max redeem script size rule](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ded687334031f4790ef6a36b999fb30a79dcf7b3/src/script/signingprovider.cpp#L160) on all scripts. Which blocks segwit redeem scripts longer than\r\nthe max element size in all the previously mentioned processes (`createmultisig`, `addmultisigaddress`, and\r\n`signrawtransactionwithkey`).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem, enabling the creation of multisig output descriptors involving more than 15 keys and\r\nallowing the signing of these scripts, along with other post-segwit redeem scripts that surpass the 520-byte\r\np2sh limit.\r\n\r\nImportant note:\r\nInstead of adding support for these longer redeem scripts in the legacy wallet, an \"unsupported operation\"\r\nerror has been added. The reasons behind this decision are:\r\n\r\n1) The introduction of this feature brings about a compatibility-breaking change that requires downgrade\r\n    protection; older wallets would be unable to interact with these \"new\" legacy wallets.\r\n\r\n2) Considering the ongoing deprecation of the legacy spkm, this issue provides another compelling\r\n    reason to transition towards descriptors.\r\n\r\nTesting notes:\r\nTo easily verify each of the fixes, I decoupled the tests into standalone commits. So they can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master. Where `rpc_createmultisig.py` (with and without the `--legacy-wallet`\r\narg) will fail without the bugs fixes commits.\r\n\r\nExtra note:\r\nThe initial commits improves the `rpc_createmultisig.py` test in many ways. I found this test very\r\nantiquated, screaming for an update and cleanup.",
