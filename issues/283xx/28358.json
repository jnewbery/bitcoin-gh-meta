It also adds a warning that it's up to users to check that they have enough RAM.\r\n\r\nFinally, we make startup abort if the value provided is too high, rather than quietly rounding it down. This doubling seems like a safe time to do that, so that users who picked a reasonable, but too previously high, round number like 20,000 won't encounter this error.\r\n\r\nFixes #28249.",
