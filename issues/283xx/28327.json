   "body" : "RFC because this is rather hackish and I'd like to know if anyone has a better idea.\r\n\r\nI'm working on trimming out headers that libbitcoinkernel should not export. To be clear: the problem is not what headers libbitcoinkernel itself uses, but what headers it requires users to use. Basically.. the headers used directly and indirectly by `bitcoin-chainstate.cpp`.\r\n\r\nTopping the list of headers we definitely don't want to require for users are `bitcoin-config.h` and `clientversion.h`. The former is somewhat complicated, but `clientversion.h` only comes from one place: `dbwrapper.h`.\r\n\r\nThis PR gets rid of that include by creating a new constructor that sets the version in the cpp file, working around the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother potential solution would be to create a `MakeClientVersionCDataStream()` function which just creates a stream and sets the version, and relies on the caller to do the rest.\r\n\r\nAny better ideas? Otherwise I'll undraft and ask for review.",
