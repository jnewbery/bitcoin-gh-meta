   "body" : "This is joint work with mzumsande. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to diversify outbound connections with respect to reachable networks. The existing logic evaluates peers for connection based purely on the frequency of available addresses in `AddrMan`. This PR adds logic to automatically connect to alternate reachable networks and adds eviction logic that protects one existing connection to each network. \r\n\r\nFor instance, if `AddrMan` is populated primarily with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and only a handful of onion addresses, it is likely that we won't establish any automatic outbound connections to Tor, even if we're capable of doing so. For smaller networks like CJDNS, this is even more of an issue and often requires adding manual peers to ensure regularly being connected to the network.\r\n\r\nConnecting to multiple networks improves resistance to eclipse attacks for individual nodes. It also benefits the entire p2p network by increasing partition resistance and privacy in general. \r\n\r\nThe automatic connections to alternate networks is done defensively, by first filling all outbound slots with random addresses (as in the status quo) and then adding additional peers from reachable networks the node is currently not connected to. This approach ensures that outbound slots are not left unfilled while attempting to connect to a network that may be unavailable due to a technical issue or misconfiguration that bitcoind cannot detect.\r\n\r\nOnce an additional peer is added and we have one more outbound connection than we want, outbound eviction ensures that peers are protected if they are the only ones for their network.\r\n\r\nManual connections are also taken into account: If a user already establishes manual connections to a trusted peer from a network, there is no longer a need to make extra efforts to ensure we also have an automatic connection to it (although this may of course happen by random selection). \r\n",
