      "body" : "Concept ACK\r\n\r\nMy preliminary testing confirmed that this PR will significantly speed up common operations like `fundrawtransaction` on wallets with many years of transaction history. A single `fundrawtransaction` RPC call that took 5 sec on a simulated large wallet now takes 50ms. Services providers with large wallets that need to make many RPC calls per minute will benefit from reduced lock contention on `cs_wallet`; for example, LSPs using bitcoin core wallets like Eclair.\r\n\r\nCaching the wallet's tx outputs in memory seems like a straight forward solution as long as the cache of tx outs in `m_txos` are always updated (or regenerated) if the underlying set of wallet txs in `mapWallet` or the `m_spk_managers` change.

What do you think about making it private and clearing `m_txos` (or adding a new flag) to trigger `RefreshWalletTXOs()` at query time?\r\n\r\nThis alternate approach would require `GetTXO(const COutPoint& outpoint)` and `GetTXOs()` to first call `RefreshWalletTXOs()` if `m_txos` is empty.  There are only a few methods that change `m_spk_managers` that would need to clear `m_txos` to trigger a one time `RefreshWalletTXOs()`:\r\n - `ImportPrivKeys`\r\n - `ImportPublicKeys`\r\n - `ImportScriptPubKeys`\r\n - `AddScriptPubKeyMan`\r\n\r\nIt's also only a small set of places where keys are imported in `backup.cpp`, so the question of leaving `RefreshWalletTXOs()` public might just be a matter of which approach would be less foot-gunny in the future and if there are disadvantages to delaying the regeneration of txos.\r\n\r\nI think you can safely make `RefreshWalletTxTXOs(const CWalletTx& wtx)` a private method now though because it is only called by wallet methods that add a wtx to `mapWallet` like `LoadToWallet` and `AddToWallet`.",
