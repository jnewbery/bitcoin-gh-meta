Not marking them as used as they were never created (or just import the address as a standalone address and not a ranged descriptor)\r\n\r\n2) If you are actually using the previous addresses, and you don't care about address re-using, maybe could add a customizable option to mark / not mark addresses as used on ranged descriptors (open for discussion)\r\n\r\n3) There is a PR, that is still a WIP, that adds db txn batch writes to the block connection and tx sync processes, so the processes don't go to disk for each independent address that requires to be marked as used (and other stuff) #25297.\r\nYou might want to give that PR branch a try.",
