I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe security of the solution provided by integration with Tor is able to be improved by allowing rejuvenation of the ephemeral hidden service. This allows that a new ephemeral hidden service can be created, or, that the hidden service is 'once only', it pops into existence, exists for a while and then disappears. \r\n\r\nProvide a gui checkbox, configuration item and command-line switch for Regenerate Ephemeral Service. In reality, when set, each time the Bitcoin Core client starts it first removes then generates new `~/bitcoin/onion_private_key`\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to add a gui button that deletes the key next startup by flag whereas the configuration item and command-line switch operate as described and delete the file every startup.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs an alternative,  a launch script could be used to remove `~/bitcoin/onion_private_key` before lauching Bitcoin Core\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThere is limited opportunity, however, for the serious about maximum privacy having the re-use of the ephemeral service allows the tracing third-party node to wait to reconnect and gather direct intelligence what transactions and blocks the node gossips. With this feature, there is no reuse.\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",
