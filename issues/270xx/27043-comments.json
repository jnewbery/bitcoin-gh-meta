And of course, these are just standardness rules so in some cases you can work with miners to get non-std stuff mined.\n\nOpenTimestamps, for example, is defined in such a way that if OpReturn is blocked it can easily use other alternatives. And in the past, it actually has.\n",

I don't think there is any reason to implement a separate rule to check if there is more than one OP_Return if you aren't limiting the size.\r\n\r\nSecond, tests. You need to check that:\r\n\r\n- The previous limit is still enforced when `datacarrierlimit` is set.\r\n- Handling of OP_Returns of any size works correctly.\r\n\r\nScriptPubKeys that fill up entire blocks already exist in testnet, eg from the time [I rick-rolled testnet](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=146197.0). But OP_Return outputs are handled very slightly, so better if you can at least find one/mine one in testnet to prove they cause no consensus problems. An explicit test for this case wouldn't hurt either. As for large numbers of OP_Returns, again, we already have transactions with large numbers of outputs and OP_Return should not be any different. But it doesn't hurt to test this explicitly.",
