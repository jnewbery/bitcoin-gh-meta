If the children are evicted, and the parents no longer bumped, they will be below min relay feerate.\r\n- A replacement transaction spends only confirmed UTXOs. This means it has 100 directly conflicting transactions (the 100 children). There are no descendants, so there are 100 original transactions in total. But accepting the replacement transaction actually invalidates not 100, but 100 * 25 = 2500 mempool transactions.\r\n- We can remove these transactions in TrimToSize(), but 2500 is considerably more than our previous limit of 100.\r\n\r\nA counterargument is that we don't currently have any guarantees that we never `TrimToSize()` more than 2500 entries at a time. We also don't have a good idea of how computationally expensive this really is. For example, it's possible that accepting a large, high-feerate transaction when the mempool is almost full causes just as many evictions. In general, when traffic is high, mempool churn is probably high as well.",

      "body" : "I guess another similar question is whether we care about the potential reorg handling slowdown. One scenario is a reorg adding below-minrelayfeerate transactions back to mempool, which we then spend time flushing through `TrimToSize()` (I suppose this is bounded by `MAX_DISCONNECTED_TX_POOL_SIZE` and the fact that it's extremely expensive to mine a bunch of free txns so that other people's reorg processing slows down). During this time, we can't build the next block template. Previously, we basically held off on flushing until the next tx was submitted, and blockmintxfee prevented low-feerate things getting into the template. I'm not sure how long this takes, will have to benchmark.",

      "body" : "Adding a trim-under-min-relay directly in `ActivateBestChainStep()` to evict 0-fee parent dangling in the mempool on an observable oracle like block propagation could break some assumptions for chain of transactions, especially if they're coming from multiple spenders. If you assume a collaborative transaction like the dual-funding specified by BOLTs, where the collaborative transaction can be RBF'ed, an old low-federate transaction could be broadcast with a high-federate package, and if this CPFP replaced, stale the opening of the dual-funded channel. I think an improvement could be at least to make the oracle hard to predict from a spying node (and if so we should probably add a filter to prevent 0-fee evicted probing with `GETDATA`).\r\n\r\nTransaction processing not being computationally cheap has already been raised in the context of https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21224 As of today, I think we would like to ensure second-layers can broadcast significant quantity of pre-signed transactions in a short period of time (e.g a LSP doing splicing with all its spokes to rebalance channels because network mempools are empty), without interferences with our current DoS limits like `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS`. Or if second-layers nodes should deploy multiple \"transaction-relay\" entry points (e.g connect to multiple full-nodes) to do some kind of initial broadcast load-balancing, that something to be thought of, I believe (and if we should modify our transaction-broadcast backend there). I think we would like to be careful to not introduce exploitable synchronicity issues, e.g in the case of massive redeployment of channel types for Lightning (e.g upgrade from anchor outputs to Taproot outputs on the commitment transaction format), see comment https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25038#issuecomment-1405944407\r\n",

The flushing logic only effects things that can't even be relayed on today's network, assuming no one is touching minrelayfeerate defaults?\r\n\r\nI did some basic benchmarking here on eviction, showing that on my machine at least it takes ~0.3s to evict a \"worst case\" scenario. Do note that it also takes roughly the same amount of time to even build up the mempool, and that's without any script checks.

      "body" : "I am still wrapping my head around how best to think about this, but a few things come to mind:\r\n\r\n1) Yes perhaps we should improve the way mempool limiting works in general, so that we either (a) automatically resubmit descendant subpackages that would be eligible for mempool acceptance due to sufficient feerate whenever they get trimmed out of the mempool due to eviction of a parent, or better (b) avoid evicting those subpackages in the first place.  \r\n\r\n2) The example I posted shows that it is possible for there to be transactions in the mempool that cannot be mined at a feerate >= minrelayfeerate, but cannot be detected as such by looking only at descendant scores (this is demonstrated if you only considered transactions B, C and E in the example I posted above).  Looking at ancestor scores is also insufficient for making this determination (as mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933#issuecomment-1416713975). This would seem to imply that we would need to do something substantially more complicated in order to prevent a situation where, after package validation is deployed, that a miner might mine a block containing a package at a feerate below the minrelayfeerate.\r\n\r\nThinking about (2), perhaps we should split our concerns about low-feerate transactions/packages in the mempool into what I think are the two components: (a) anti-DoS and (b) maximizing miner income.\r\n\r\nFor (a) anti-DoS, I don't believe there is a DoS concern if we both mine everything in the mempool and only encounter this situation due to these RBF scenarios where no free relay is going on.  So really the concern is just (b), how do we ensure that a miner is never worse off for including some transactions that are in the mempool.\r\n\r\nWe could just try to cut out the most obvious problems -- transactions that are literally 0-fee to the miner.  If we restrict the allowed topologies for package validation, we may be able to do better than that, but I don't know if that's a direction we want to go down.  @ajtowns' idea in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26933 may work as well, but I'm wondering how we can generalize our thinking of what we're trying to specifically achieve?",
