Firstly in regards to ASNs nothing seems to be hard coded into the generation process currently other than a parse to an external service. Currently each seed ip-address is parsed though xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.origin.asn.cymru.com. Does this task imply that a complete list of ASNs should be stored locally and updated periodically? The current cost of a complete compressed list of ASNs and their IP address blocks is ~5.5MB. \r\n\r\nSecondly does this mean there should be a suspicious ASNs file? I don't think this is the correct interpretation.\r\n\r\nIf all my interpretations are incorrect please let me know.",
