Large amounts of data are already published in the bitcoin blockchain in a variety of ways. Heck, `-permitbaremultisig` is still allowed by default, and people still use it to publish data in the form of spendable and even unspendable outputs. And unlike OP_Return outputs, bare multisig outputs have caused issued due to Bitcoin's broken sigop counting scheme; the OP_Return mechanism was carefully designed to avoid this problem years ago.\r\n\r\nThis proposed change simply cleans up a bit of remaining standardness paternalism; we've gotten rid of essentially all other standardness paternalism. I can't think of any standardness mechanism other than OP_Return and first-seen (which I'm arguing to remove by default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132)  that doesn't have a strong technical reason to exist.\r\n\r\n> > is paying me $1000 for 10 hours work to do this pull-req\r\n> \r\n> That's great, but others have to spend hours reviewing this stuff, plus occasionally having to deal with the brigading.

Others said they might contribute to that bounty as well. My real goal was to have a legitimate discussion, which is what we have been having here. It is a discussion in PRs, with working code, that is how change really happens in bitcoin.\r\n\r\nMy goal is not \"non-bitcoin stuff\". My specific challenge is that Lightning and Nostr use public keys in a persistent way that are not rotatable, which is a bad cryptographic practice. By committing to a rotated key and some other cryptographic in advance in L1, they could be.  I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata. However, this is larger than 80-byte limit in OP_RETURN. I can now put it into an inscription-style transaction and even get a 4x discount, or use bare multisig, or use some other trick.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'd prefer not to use a \"trick\", and use OP_RETURN as it is easy to identify, was explicitly created for this purpose, is not a hack, and nodes can easily ignore them. Given that the OP_RETURN limit is a relic of `is_standard`, and as @instagibbs said is \"the last remaining 'paternalism' restriction in the codebase\", and there are multiple ways to do what I'm seeking in less \"honest\" ways, so why have this legacy limit at all? Thus my reasoning to contribute to the bounty for this PR.\r\n\r\nIf @petertodd doesn't have time to continue to continue to support this PR, I'm glad to contribute toward bounties (hopefully with others) for others to keep it active.\r\n\r\n-- Christopher Allen, Blockchain Commons",

I believe this could be as small as a signed hash and a little metadata.\r\n\r\n@ChristopherA can you clarify why is it imperative for this use case to store that data on the Bitcoin blockchain?\r\n\r\nTo give you some insight into my point of view: I'm a Bitcoin user and full node runner and my primary concern is that running a full node continues to be affordable for the rest of the 21st century, as it's necessary to maintain a global network of independent validators & copies of the blockchain. Storing non-transactional data in the blockchain makes this arbitrarily more difficult. Ceteris paribus if we encourage using the Bitcoin blockchain as a storage medium there will be much less full nodes in 2070 than otherwise. Personally I'd like to see the devs working on new standardness rules to fight the spam, not removing the existing ones.\r\n\r\nSo I hope you'll understand why I don't agree with removing `-datacarrier` nor increasing the default `-datacarriersize`, but I'm willing to live by the status quo. I'd like to ask you to try to work around the 80 byte limit if at all possible, maybe with a more compact hash and metadata encoding scheme.",

Removing the spam protection for op_return outputs effectively results in a discount for small inscriptions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you're saying yourself that you want this change because it makes it easier for you to use the chain for contentious non-bitcoin use cases such as inscribing Nostr keys. However, the reason why you currently have to use hacks to do that is simply because others just don't want to have to download and store your data to use Bitcoin. The fact that we can't prevent these kind of spam attacks is not a justification to make the problem worse. \r\n\r\nAlso I wonder why you don't use torrents to store your data? \r\n\r\n",
