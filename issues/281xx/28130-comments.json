Large amounts of data are already published in the bitcoin blockchain in a variety of ways. Heck, `-permitbaremultisig` is still allowed by default, and people still use it to publish data in the form of spendable and even unspendable outputs. And unlike OP_Return outputs, bare multisig outputs have caused issued due to Bitcoin's broken sigop counting scheme; the OP_Return mechanism was carefully designed to avoid this problem years ago.\r\n\r\nThis proposed change simply cleans up a bit of remaining standardness paternalism; we've gotten rid of essentially all other standardness paternalism. I can't think of any standardness mechanism other than OP_Return and first-seen (which I'm arguing to remove by default in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28132)  that doesn't have a strong technical reason to exist.\r\n\r\n> > is paying me $1000 for 10 hours work to do this pull-req\r\n> \r\n> That's great, but others have to spend hours reviewing this stuff, plus occasionally having to deal with the brigading.
