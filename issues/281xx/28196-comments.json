But are there any known reachable mainnet nodes folks can test against? (testnet and signet is fine too I suppose)\r\n\r\nI would be useful to have at least one log message in the lifetime of a peer to indicate it's a v2. E.g. `[net] Added v2 connection peer=â¦` (haven't checked if we already know it's v2 at that point)\r\n\r\nDo I assume correctly that `0` refers to size of the message payload, i.e. ignoring the (short) message id (what was a header in v1)? `[net] sending verack (0 bytes)`",
