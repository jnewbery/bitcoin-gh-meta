   "body" : "BIP32 allows both `'` and `h` as hardened derivation marker. Our legacy wallet uses `'`. Since #26076 our descriptor wallets use `h` by default.\r\n\r\n`ParseHDKeypath` only supports `'`. It's currently only used in the legacy wallet context, so this doesn't cause any problems. But it will once #22341 uses it (to parse the RPC `path` argument for `getxpub`). Might as well fix it now.\r\n\r\nI added a restriction for not combining `h` and `'`. Afaik this currently isn't enforced anywhere else in the codebase, including for descriptors, but it seems sane. I've occasionally messed that up in the past.",
