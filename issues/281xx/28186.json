   "body" : "Leveldb headers are currently included in the `dbwrapper.h` file and thus available to many of Bitcoin Core's source files. However, leveldb-specific functionality should be abstracted by the `dbwrapper` and does not need to be available to the rest of the code. Having leveldb included in a widely-used header such as `dbwrapper.h` bloats the entire project's header tree.\r\n\r\nThe `dbwrapper` is a key component of the libbitcoinkernel library. Future users of this library would not want to contend with  having the leveldb headers exposed and potentially polluting their project's namespace.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the leveldb headers are removed from the `dbwrapper` by moving leveldb-specific code to the implementation file and creating a [pimpl](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/pimpl) where leveldb member variables are indispensable. As a final step, the leveldb include flags are removed from the `BITCOIN_INCLUDES` and moved to places where the dbwrapper is compiled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587), and more specifically its stage 1 step 3 \"Decouple most non-consensus headers from libbitcoinkernel\".",
