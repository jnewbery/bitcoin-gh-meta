   "body" : "This modernizes the ChaCha20 and ChaCha20Aligned interfaces to be `Span<std::byte>` based, and other improvements.\r\n\r\n* Removes our OpenSSH-inspired variant of the ChaCha20Poly1305 AEAD (which was added in anticipation of BIP324 using it, but the spec was later changed to using the RFC8439 one unmodified). #28008 replaces the code anyway, so it is pointless to apply the refectoring done in this PR to that old code.\r\n* Modifies all functions and constructors of `ChaCha20` and `ChaCha20Aligned` to be `Span<std::byte>` based.\r\n* Remove default constructors, to make sure all call sites provide a key (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26153#discussion_r1129313162)\r\n* Wipe key material on destruction for security (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26153#discussion_r1267164605)\r\n* Use `HexStr` on byte vectors in tests (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27993#discussion_r1262023316)\r\n* Support `std::byte` vectors in `ConsumeRandomLengthByteVector` and `ConsumeFixedLengthByteVector`, and use it (suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27993#discussion_r1265337111)\r\n* And a few more.\r\n\r\nWhile related, I don't see this as a necessary for BIP324. Some changes here are also in #28008, but either or both can go in.",
