      "body" : "> In environments where individual binaries are required/desired (e.g. oss-fuzz [1]), this has the benefit that each binary is as small as possible, resulting in less disk usage (nice for container images).\r\n\r\nI don't think this works, because the other fuzz targets presumably only consume a minimal amount of binary space. Most of the space is consumed by all the core libraries (libtest_util, libutil, libkernel, libcommon, ...)?\r\n\r\n> Enable afl++ to create a token dictionary at compile time, which only contains tokens that are found in code paths reachable by each individual harness.\r\n\r\nI don't think this works, due to the runtime registration indirection via the function pointer in a std::map. I think this is also a blocker for fuzz-introspector, etc.\r\n\r\n> Change the build system to have an option to compile individual binaries\r\n\r\nThe option already exists and OSS-Fuzz is using the option.\r\n\r\nObviously, pull requests with improvements are welcome to remove the `std::map`, but I don't think reducing the size will be possible, unless you completely rework the internal library design of Bitcoin Core?",
