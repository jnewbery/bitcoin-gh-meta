      "body" : "`importwallet` does not import any metadata, including whether something is the seed. That it overwrites the seed metadata is expected behavior, although it should still work as the seed. You can check whether both wallets use the same seed by looking at `hdseedid` in `getwalletinfo`, and also generating some addresses to see if both wallets recognize them with `getaddressinfo`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the workflow that you are using uses the legacy wallet storage format which is targeted to be removed soon. If there is indeed an issue, it is unlikely that it will be fixed, particularly as the effect that you want to achieve can be done with different methods. I do want to note though that the same wallet on two nodes is not recommended as metadata will not be the same and there can still be discrepancies between the copies of the wallet due to things such as RBF and related issues with unconfirmed transactions.",
