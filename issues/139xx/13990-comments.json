      "body" : "I had asked a related [question](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/100861/why-cant-default-minimum-fee-rate-be-changed-to-0-1-0-2-sat-vbyte) in December 2020. Pieter Wuille answered it with following things:\r\n\r\n1. > Why can't we change default minimum fee rate to something below 1 sat/vByte?\r\n\r\n> The primary reason for the minimum feerate (and related things like the discard feerate) is preventing the use of the P2P network as a cheap global broadcast system. If it's easy to produce transaction that will never confirm yet will relay across the network, it'd open the network to abuse. I don't know what the right level is to make sure that doesn't happen, but 1 sat/vbyte seems pretty low\r\n\r\n2. > It was done in past: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3305 why not again?\r\n\r\n> That was before the network and mempool logic had floating fees. Now the feerate is primarily set by market pressure, and lowering the minimum would at most have an impact during times when there is ~no demand for block space. I personally think the ecosystem should expect to function fine when there is continuous back pressure, so I'm not sure what is gained by reducing it.\r\n\r\n3. > Do you think it will result in spamming? I don't think so and few other people as well: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/kjrbny/should_default_minimum_fee_rate_be_01_satvbyte_now/ggyym67\r\n\r\n> I don't think spam is the problem. Lately the feerate has been significantly higher than 1 sat/vbyte anyway, and long term I hope that whatever the minimum is set to, it's effectively never hit. What matters is the discard feerate, which is not set by the market (it's the \"additional\" feerate you need to pay to replace a transaction in the mempool through RBF or mempool limiting, in order to make sure there is some cost to relaying the transaction that is now expected to not be mined anymore). That discard feerate is by default set to 1 sat/vbyte as well, which seems low.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this answer and looking at few stats I am not sure if this is required. Also there is no way to test if lower fee rates will increase transactions and fee revenue for miners or decrease. Or if someone can find better charts and ways to test this before being used then we can re-evaluate. If we don't have lower default min fee rates, fee estimation for lower fee rates doesn't make sense so I have no opinion on this or weak NACK for now:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13405205/127573869-406ed8e3-6861-4f12-87b8-9b40974f5845.png)\r\n",

There's two sorts of spam made more accessible by lowering the fee rate: spam that makes it into what would otherwise have been non-full blocks, which increases the resources needed for IBD; and spam that only ever goes through the p2p network and mempool, increasing the bandwidth cost of running a full node -- if you change the min fee to 0.1 sat/vbyte but keep the min incremental relay fee were left at 1 sat/vbyte, this might be pretty minimal though.\r\n\r\n@rebroad \r\n\r\n> sorry for the noob-like question, but why is so much code needed to simply reduce the minfee...?\r\n\r\nIt's not changing the minfee, it's changing the range of values the fee estimation code supports. That needs a bunch of code mostly in order to support updating the old data set with a smaller range to a new data set with a larger range.\r\n\r\nIf you did the \"one-line change\" to update the minfee without updating the fee estimates, you'd always be told you need to pay at least 1sat/vbyte for your txs anyway; if you did it without the update code, fee estimates would only go below 1sat/vbyte for new installs or if you delete the `fee_estimates.dat` file.\r\n\r\n@tryphe\r\n\r\n> I think it might be helpful to split this up into two PRs: one changing the minimum feerate variable\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't change the minimum feerate variable -- that's `DEFAULT_MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE` (validation.h) and `DEFAULT_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE` (policy/policy.h) for mempool, and also `WALLET_INCREMENTAL_RELAY_FEE` (wallet/wallet.h) for the wallet.\r\n\r\n",

There's two sorts of spam made more accessible by lowering the fee rate: spam that makes it into what would otherwise have been non-full blocks, which increases the resources needed for IBD; and spam that only ever goes through the p2p network and mempool, increasing the bandwidth cost of running a full node -- if you change the min fee to 0.1 sat/vbyte but keep the min incremental relay fee were left at 1 sat/vbyte, this might be pretty minimal though.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not needed if we don't have fee rates below 1 sat/vbyte.
