This is probably not the case for Bitcoin, where the difference between *run one multi-homed node* and *run two single-homed nodes* is substantial enough for a regular user, so we better facilitate it (at least continue implementing basic privacy improvements).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, things like #27509 hopefully reduce the node mapping risks w.r.t. transaction relay privacy.\r\n\r\nI intend to think more about adequate solutions to this issue and suggest a PR.",
