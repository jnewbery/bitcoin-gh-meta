I am able to retrieve the captcha using `curl -v  https://signetfaucet.com/captcha`, also using HTTP1.1 (which I think `requests` is limited to?), but unable using python.\r\n\r\nPerhaps @kallewoof can shed some light on whether using Cloudflare is new to this site and if it therefore is what's caused the breakage?\r\n\r\nIt seems that even other [options](https://github.com/kaliiiiiiiiii/Selenium-Driverless) would provide only intermittent results at best (until Cloudflare changes blocking heuristics)...",
