We are not working with a functional language in this repository, so there is no strict need for recursion.\r\n\r\n> I think bugs are just as likely to occur in loops and you will also find a lot of examples for that.\r\n\r\nStack overflows caused by recursion is a specific class of bugs that can be avoided by simply not using recursion. Not using loops is obviously not an option in this repository. However, clang-tidy checks to avoid bugprone loop patterns might make sense in the same spirit as discouraging recursion, e.g. https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/bugprone/infinite-loop.html.\r\n\r\n> A developer who is experienced with it should be able to use it if they think it's the right tool for the job.\r\n\r\nI'm not proposing a ban on recursion.
