The solution implemented here, augments the mempool transaction `REPLACED` signal with the double-spending transaction which the wallet stores and watches for in Block notifications. A map is added to the wallet to track conflicting tx ids and their child transactions.  The entry is erased when the double-spending tx is removed from MemPool.\r\n",
