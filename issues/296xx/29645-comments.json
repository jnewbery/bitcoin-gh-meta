      "body" : "Here's some historical context regarding translation related changes suggested in this PR.\r\n\r\nBasically, during a release process, there are two kind of operations namely (1) generating an updated resource file and uploading it to the Transifex website and (2) downloading prepared translations from the Transifex website and merging them into this repository.\r\n\r\nThe first kind involves running `make -C src translate` command. The second one uses `update-translations.py` script from the `bitcoin-maintainer-tools` repository, which in turn relies on Transifex's command-line `tx` client.\r\n\r\nIn the past, release maintainers performed all these steps by themselves. Then the process became more involved, requiring an additional interaction between a release maintainer and a developer who conducts translation-related stages.\r\n\r\nDuring the v26.0 release, @fanquake suggested (offline) to fetch translations from the Transifex website just before branching a version branch off. That would allow to keep translations in the master branch updated with no extra efforts.\r\n\r\nThis PR goes further and proposes skipping translation fetching for every release candidate.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the v27.0 release is following the translation handling process as this PR suggests.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of a new approach is less burden on a release maintainer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can see a couple of drawbacks as well:\r\n\r\n1. Translators have a shorter period to work on translations. Effectively, it starts at string freeze and ends at branching off, which usually lasts for a month.\r\n\r\n2. If a translatable string is modified after branching off, it won't be translated in the release binary.\r\n\r\nBeing a translator allows me to assume that a month is enough even for a single person assuming they work on a single translation. Also we heavy exploit the \"Translation Memory\" Transifex feature, which effectively is a cache allowing to reuse translations from the previous releases.\r\n\r\nThe second case might be considered as a very rare event.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this change in the release process deserves an announcement for translators on the Transifex website.\r\n\r\ncc translation-involved people: @luke-jr @laanwj ",

I felt that it was appropriate to move from \"before every release candidate\" to ~\"before every major or minor release\"~(EDIT: correction, \"before branch-off\") because\r\n- I didn't observe that translations were being updated per release candidate.\r\n- It made more sense to me that it'd be per release instead of per release candidate since, as you say, changes in between rcs should be very rare and we would largely have control over this.\r\n- As you mentioned, translations were added before branch off this time.\r\n\r\n> Translators have a shorter period to work on translations. Effectively, it starts at string freeze and ends at branching off, which usually lasts for a month.\r\n\r\nIn practice, is there a large time difference between branch off and the first release candidate?\r\n\r\nI made this change because it seemed like more accurate documentation, definitely not as an attempt to make a controversial alteration the release process. I don't feel strongly and am happy to remove that change.",

I felt that it was appropriate to move from \"before every release candidate\" to ~\"before every major or minor release\"~(EDIT: correction, \"before branch-off\") because\r\n> \r\n>    * I didn't observe that translations were being updated per release candidate.\r\n\r\nIt happens, but very seldom. We can really ignore them as it simplifies the release process significantly.\r\n\r\n>    * It made more sense to me that it'd be per release instead of per release candidate since, as you say, changes in between rcs should be very rare and we would largely have control over this.\r\n> \r\n>    * As you mentioned, translations were added before branch off this time.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we have to update translations for minor releases.\r\n\r\ncc @laanwj \r\n\r\n> > Translators have a shorter period to work on translations. Effectively, it starts at string freeze and ends at branching off, which usually lasts for a month.\r\n> \r\n> In practice, is there a large time difference between branch off and the first release candidate?\r\n\r\nNot at all :)",
