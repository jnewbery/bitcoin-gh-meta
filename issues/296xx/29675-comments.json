      "body" : "> What do you mean by \"older\"? Just that the PR to libsecp needs another rebase?\r\n\r\nI pulled in a commit that is probably outdated at this point. There may have been API changes since.\r\n\r\n> We could similarly store the nonce in our wallet and then delete the field at the start of the new round. For safety we could disable backups and dump RPC's while a round is in progress (e.g. with a `NO_BACKUP` flag).\r\n\r\nDisabling backups with a flag would not help as an oft suggested method for backing up a wallet is by copying the wallet file. There's nothing that we can do about that, so to be safe, I don't think we can store the nonces in the wallet file.\r\n\r\n> I tried making a 2 party tr(musig(A,B)) in a blank wallet. Initially I obtained two private keys and their public keys from another legacy wallet. I gave the new Alice wallet her private key and Bob's public key, i.e. `tr(musig(a,B)/0/*)` but this failed with `Ranged musig() requires all participants to be xpubs`. Why though? Given that bip-musig2-derivation defines a virtual root xpub, and providers a fake chaincode, this restriction seems unneeded? (though it's not blocker either, with descriptor wallets it's easy to get an xpub - after #29130 anyway)\r\n\r\nIt's specified in bip-musig2-descriptors that the musig must only contain xpubs if the aggregate will be derived from. I believe the rationale for this is that xpubs are intended to have derivation done on them whereas normal keys are not, and so there may be particular handling of such keys to deal with possibilities of derivation doing something unexpected, and so if we do anything with derivation, we should only use keys that are intended for derivation to avoid any confusion. I think @sipa was the one who made this suggestion.\r\n\r\n> Sadly after the GUI rugged me :-) Trying to send any amount elsewhere resulted in \"Signing transaction failed\" followed by \"Transaction creation failed!\". Whereas I was hoping to get a PSBT this way.\r\n\r\nThe GUI may be expecting that at least one signature is produced, but we can't do that with musig without at least one round with the cosigners. I have it implemented such that `ProduceSignature` does not report the tx as being signed until there is actually a signature, so even the partial sigs generation will not return \"signed\".\r\n\r\n> After a restart Bob's `walletprocesspsbt` command didn't fail. Which seems wrong: at this point the nonce should be gone, which he should complain about.\r\n\r\nCurrently it just ignores if there is already a nonce for a participant's key. It doesn't replace the nonce, but it also doesn't validate whether that key belongs to the wallet or whether the nonce exists in the wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\n> At this point all the nonces were commited, so Bob could have added his partial signature. But at the stage the GUI crashes when trying to sign: `[libsecp256k1] illegal argument: secp256k1_memcmp_var(&nonce->data[0], secp256k1_musig_pubnonce_magic, 4) == 0`.\r\n> ...\r\n> Starting with a fresh transaction, sing only the RPC I got the same crash, i.e.:\r\n> \r\n>     1. Alice: `send`\r\n> \r\n>     2. Alice: `processpsbt`\r\n> \r\n>     3. Bob: `processpsbt`\r\n> \r\n>     4. Bob: `processpsbt`: crash\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Perhaps relevant: Bob's wallet is encrypted, though it was unlocked throughout steps 3 and 4.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n>  % test/functional/wallet_musig.py \r\n> 2024-03-19T14:23:33.113000Z TestFramework (INFO): PRNG seed is: 6470719924404054174\r\n> 2024-03-19T14:23:33.115000Z TestFramework (INFO): Initializing test directory /var/folders/h6/qrb4j9vn6530kp7j4ymj934h0000gn/T/bitcoin_func_test_66knao3l\r\n> 2024-03-19T14:23:35.070000Z TestFramework (INFO): Testing rawtr(musig(keys/*))\r\n> 2024-03-19T14:23:35.192000Z TestFramework (ERROR): Unexpected exception caught during testing\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> (didn't check if it's the same crash)\r\n\r\nHuh, works fine for me.\r\n\r\n",
