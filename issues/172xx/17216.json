See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a22b62481aae95747830bd3c0db3227860b12d8e/src/logging.cpp#L56\r\nThat means that on slow disks (non-ssd, mostly), calls to `LogPrint*()` are potentially expensive and blocking further execution of the calling thread (potentially the net processing or validation thread).\r\n\r\nMoving logging to a background thread should be fine, except for some edge cases:\r\n* We use `assert_debug_log` in the functional tests, which assume that a message is written to the debug log synchronous. However, the recently added polling to `assert_debug_log` should work around that.\r\n* The logging thread should probably be started when logging is started and shut down when the node is shut down. Calls to logging during shutdown should probably be in-line.",
