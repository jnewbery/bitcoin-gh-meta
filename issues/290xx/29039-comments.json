      "body" : "At the end of this sequence of patches the `VersionBitsCache` object provides a standalone interface to all the \"versionbits\" features needed by bitcoin core, which means that if the BIP9/speedy trial implementation is changed in future, it should be possible to do that in one place, without needing to change validation/RPC code as well.\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies and modernises some of the code, much of which has been proposed previously (eg, removing the params arguments from AbstractThresholdConditionChecker was included in the first versions of #21380; making threshold a per-deployment params was part of #19573 and #21392).\r\n\r\nAfter these changes, it should be possible to simplify the unit/fuzz tests a little, as they should now be able to use `VersionBitsConditionChecker` directly, since it no longer depends on access to `Consensus::Params`.",
