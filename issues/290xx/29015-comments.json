That would presumably mean util/bitdeque.h and util/sock.cpp should also eventually go elsewhere, for example? That seems like a bad approach to me (in that it means code has to move into and out of util based on whether it's relevant to the kernel, rather than due to any changes to the code itself, and users then potentially have to deal with it moving into/outof the util:: namespace).",

As for now, it reads:\r\n\r\nThis seems like the right place to talk about the relationship between the util and kernel library. My work on the kernel library has been focusing on reducing its essence to validation code, pruning external dependencies, and stripping out as much system related functionality as possible. I think if the goal is to have the kernel be capable of running on as many platforms as possible, potentially beyond the number of platforms that Bitcoin Core is capable of today and extending into embedded environments, this last point becomes crucial.\r\n\r\nLooking at the content of `util` it provides roughly two types of functionality: Utilities for basic data structures and their serialization, and cross-platform system related utilities, like file handling, threading, process handling, etc. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, making the `util` library a proper dependency of the kernel should not introduce new cross-platform system-related content into the kernel library. Besides potentially limiting use cases of the kernel, providing cross-platform utilities beyond what the kernel strictly requires seems like a potentially unreasonable future maintenance burden. This would be contrary to our incremental process of creating a minimal kernel library.\r\n\r\nThe asterisk here is that some of the utilities that are not currently used by the kernel do not introduce new dependencies, since they entirely rely on code that is already used by the kernel. I also generally think that some utilities could remain in the util library even though they are not currently used by validation code. The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\n1. The module is directly used by kernel code.\r\n2. The module contains basic data structure utilities for interacting with kernel code.\r\n3. The module does not contain system-related utilities that are not directly used by the kernel.\r\n4. The module does not contain project-specific code that is not relevant to the kernel.\r\n5. The module does not introduce new dependencies beyond the current dependencies of the kernel.\r\n\r\nLooking at @hebasto's comment [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28690#pullrequestreview-1774033780), `threadinterrupt.cpp` and `readwritefile.cpp` would violate the 3rd criteria in my eyes, while the `spanparsing` and `bytevectorhash` modules could potentially remain in `util`.\r\n\r\nBetween this PR and #28690 I think it would be nice if common criteria for `util` would be defined and documented. All this said, I think it would be acceptable too if things were kept purposefully vague as they are now until the need for more concrete structures arises.",

I could see this being useful in the future if util library started growing a lot and accumulating more features of over time.\r\n\r\nBut for now, IMO, just sticking with the current util/common separation and using the cleanup in this PR would organize things better and be less confusing than having two util versions, and it would require moving fewer things. Even though the libraries.md document is currently ambiguous, I think it should be pretty easy to remove the ambiguity here.\r\n\r\nre: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29015#issuecomment-1849026409\r\n\r\n> The criteria I propose for evaluating if modules should remain in util after this PR are:\r\n\r\nI think these are good rules if you replace \"basic data structure utilities\" with \"basic utilities that to do not require outside dependencies\", and also drop the 3rd rule.

I just don't you need to `rm src/util/sock.cpp` to achieve these goals. As long as the util library is distributed as a static library, or built as a static library and linked into a dynamic library, the socket functions will not be part of resulting executables if they are not called. And if the kernel is being built for a platform which doesn't support sockets at all, `src/util/sock.cpp` can just be stubbed or not compiled at all and there should be no problem for portability either. I do think it's good to keep the util library small and lightweight and remove things which don't fit there. But I don't think it needs to be stripped down in a more extreme way.",

Then again, if `sock.cpp` uses common modules, why is it in `util` in the first place? To provide another concrete example,  there is `thread.cpp`, which I was hoping to remove from the kernel in #28960. If it is removed, how could the kernel library be guarded from its future re-introduction if it remains in the `util` library?",

The main place where `TransactionError` codes are actually used, and the place where the type was introduced in #14978 was in `node/transaction.h` and `node/transaction.cpp` for the `BroadcastTransaction` function. But disappointingly I think, the same type was also reused in other places like wallet code and psbt code, with extra enum values added to support these. I think it would be better if the enum were split up so it would be clearer which functions returned which values, so for example, you would not be goaded by compiler into writing error handling code for enum values that could never be returned. \r\n\r\nWith this background, I thought for this PR putting `TransactionError` in `node` instead of `common` would be better so it would be more likely to be appropriately used for functions like `node::BroadcastTransaction` and `interfaces::Node::broadTransaction`, and less likely to be misused for non-node functions. I could understand the opposite argument, though, that if even if it belongs in `node` when used ideally, it makes more sense for it to be in `common` based on the way it is used now.\r\n\r\nMore generally, I do think it's good for public node types to be defined in the node library, even if they may be also used by outside code (such as as GUI code or code in src/interfaces/ or src/common/). It makes the outside code clearer and more self documenting if you can see which libraries types are coming from. CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState are examples of other node types which are used by the GUI outside  the node library. AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl are examples of wallet types used by the GUI outside the wallet library, and I think in both cases it is helpful for these types to have node:: and wallet:: prefixes when used by outside code.\r\n\r\nBut this is just to explain my reasoning. I wouldn't oppose moving the type to common if you think that is better. I will also look into splitting up the TransactionError type to see if there's an easy way to clean this up completely.",

Then again, if `sock.cpp` uses common modules, why is it in `util` in the first place?\r\n\r\nI'm actually not sure what is this referring to. Running `nm ./src/util/libbitcoin_util_a-sock.o --undefined-only` I see sock.cpp is using LogInstance, NodeClock, and SysErrorString which should all be part of the util library.\r\n\r\n> To provide another concrete example, there is `thread.cpp`, which I was hoping to remove from the kernel in #28960. If it is removed, how could the kernel library be guarded from its future re-introduction if it remains in the `util` library?\r\n\r\n`thread.h` contains `TraceThread` which seems like a nice utility for the naming threads (which is helpful for monitoring in top) and printing exceptions (which is useful for debugging). I guess kernel code isn't currently using this function (or #28960 removes the last usage), but as long as kernel code is calling threads, what benefit is to preventing kernel code from calling this function? It seems like a useful function, and if anything more code should use it, I would think.\r\n\r\nI do agree with goals of making the kernel small and portable, and agree we should organize libraries with that in mind. I also think we should try to trigger link errors to enforce API boundaries. It just seems to me we can do these things without moving a lot around.",

I wasn't expecting paragraphs of response :)\r\n\r\nYeah sorry thanks for pinning down the actual concern. Before you just said it \"seems odd\" so I felt like I needed to justify my entire thought process.\r\n\r\nIn any case, both the node and wallet libraries expose public types which I listed above (CNodeStats, CNodeStateStats, and SynchronizationState, AddressPurpose, isminetype, CRecipient, and CCoinControl) which can be considered part of the interfaces to these libraries, but are not part of the libraries themselves. For example, the GUI code is not allowed to call node or wallet functions, but it uses all of these public types, and this is fine. Other code, including code in common, can also use these types and there is no problem with this.\r\n\r\nWe do have a choice where about where to put public types which are not really part of any library. We can put them in the interfaces directory, or in common, or in the node and wallet directories. Personally, I think it makes sense to put them in the wallet directory when they are related to wallet functionality and used by wallet code, put them in the node directory when they are related to node functionality and used by node code, put them in the common directory when they are related to common functionality (like PSBT) and used by common code. The comments at the top of {node,wallet,common}/types.h files are meant to explain the idea that these are public types.\r\n\r\n> Doesn't really seem worth worrying about the fact that some of the errors only make sense in a node context; aren't these all just \"something went wrong, deal with it, dear user\"?\r\n\r\nYes if errors are just being propagated to the user level, you don't care about this at all, and it's probably a mistake to use an enum to begin with because the error messages won't be able to contain useful context. In this case, though, the errors are being translated to RPC codes, and RPC callers may actually want to implement different forms of error handling, so it would be good to be clear about what errors are possible, plus it's easy to do, so I did add a new commit splitting PSBTError from TransactionError.\r\n\r\n> BTW, I think `TransactionError::P2P_DISABLED` can be dropped entirely? (I think the last/only use was removed in #15713)\r\n\r\nThanks, the new commit drops this code too.",

Letting the util library depend on the crypto library seems like the easiest path to take because random.cpp, randomenv.cpp, hasher.cpp, and bytevectorhash.cpp are using the crypto hash functions. But I added new commits to the PR to remove the util dependency on crypt, and remove consensus and common dependencies on util. I also added a [script](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/blob/pr/rmutil/test/util/check-deps.sh) which turned up a few other other unexpected dependencies (not related to util), which could be addressed separately. I think the script should be able to run in CI, too, but I did not set that up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 5eeafeb302dcf56dd5c16c1e4785a41a132344c7 -> 6ea5ee5a268cfbb9cd234e0f1381c8a4785ff04c ([`pr/rmutil.13`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.13) -> [`pr/rmutil.14`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.14), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/rmutil.13-rebase..pr/rmutil.14)) adding dependency checking script and removing unexpected dependencies related to util",

Rebased now.\r\n\r\n>  If other reviewers or maintainers are not happy with introducing a bash script, I could volunteer some time to translate it.\r\n\r\nYes this could be a good idea. The script started out just being a few lines of bash listing symbols exported by one library and imported by another one. But then it grew as it was extended to support multiple libraries and suppress known errors. So now it's no longer a small script, though it is pretty clean and well commented. Other possible followups besides translating the script could be:\r\n\r\n- Running the script as part of CI\r\n- Cleaning up unexpected dependencies listed as suppressions in the script.\r\n---\r\n\r\nRebased 7689dfd6646054a0be8e62ccbf72d5403e28b548 -> 1c26d10b23bb7a7d0204b4a8b44a50fad89f2a2a ([`pr/rmutil.18`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.18) -> [`pr/rmutil.19`](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/commits/pr/rmutil.19), [compare](https://github.com/ryanofsky/bitcoin/compare/pr/rmutil.18-rebase..pr/rmutil.19)) due to silent conflict with #30098",
