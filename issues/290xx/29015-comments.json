That would presumably mean util/bitdeque.h and util/sock.cpp should also eventually go elsewhere, for example? That seems like a bad approach to me (in that it means code has to move into and out of util based on whether it's relevant to the kernel, rather than due to any changes to the code itself, and users then potentially have to deal with it moving into/outof the util:: namespace).",
