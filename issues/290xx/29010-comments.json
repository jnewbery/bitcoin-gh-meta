(Unrelated: Not even sure how this will interact with cmake)\r\n\r\nIt seems easier to just put a one-line bash command into the readme to achieve the same, for anyone that needs it (oss-fuzz, fuzz-introspector, afl-lto, etc ...).\r\n\r\nHappy to provide more feedback, but for now it would be good to explain why each target needs to be in a separate file.\r\n\r\nIn C++ it should be possible to have more than one function in the same file. Also, given that `FuzzFrameworkRegisterTarget` isn't called for the function pointer, LTO should see this and nuke the function?",
