It did not work for bitcoin-qt.\r\n- This time, I additionally switched off \"indexing of all files\" (set by Windows) for this drive (is in properties). \r\nAfter plugging drive to linux machine bitcoin-qt started to progress further.\r\n\r\nNote aside. Perhaps, there is an issue with drive USB-cable, which I did not replace yet. \r\n",
