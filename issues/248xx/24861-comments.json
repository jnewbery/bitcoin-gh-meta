Revisiting this I think could be good.  I typically build with `./configure --disable-external-signer`\r\n\r\nThat being said, my main goal is setting up (offline) multisig with Bitcoin Core, and I think it is many other people's goals to set up a wallet as you described in the OP - so thank you for setting up this umbrella issue Sjors! We are getting closer and closer to the final goal!\r\n\r\nI think some other PRs that could be good to add to the above tasklist would be:\r\n\r\nFor Taproot support for external signers: (Besides the already linked #22558 in the OP):\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23578\r\nThere's also an issue created in HWI repo to track Taproot support:\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/501\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Miniscript PRs:\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24860\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/86\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/89\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25540\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/87\r\n\r\nDescriptors\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22838\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24361\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/pull/92\r\n\r\nThe GUI probably should be built with the new QML based fork?

Since then, there's been further work and standardization on this project.  I am raising this bounty to $10,000, to be paid out in bitcoin.  Payments will be made in part as individual tasklists are completed; to be divided up to developers who worked on the code and helped review it; at my discretion.

Imo putting a feature freeze on the widgets GUI and slowly moving towards QML as the project develops would prevent a lot of technical debt - something we don't have a lot of room for.\r\n\r\nTagging others on the project for visibility @GBKS @promag @Mogashni. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking ahead as to how an app like this would function, [Nunchuk](https://github.com/nunchuk-io/nunchuk-desktop) is a great example and imo easier to use than Specter. @hugohn \r\n\r\n",
