At that point if that tx is included in blocks you generate, they will be invalid.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons this feature continues to only be available on test nets, not mainnet.\r\n\r\nHaving this be available in mainline bitcoin may make it easier to observe test transactions using proposed new soft-fork features (eg OP_CAT or SIGHASH_APO is enabled via the inquisition client which considers those txs standard, but the mainline client will consider them non-standard and has no option to accept them).
