The persisted `reindexing` value is read from the database with a call to `LoadBlockIndex`. Further down, this would lead to the coins being wiped again after a restart. Meaning if the user restarts without setting reindex, but with reindexing set in the database, it would not wipe the block tree db, but would wipe the coins, while with the current behaviour it would not wipe anything and continue from where it left off.",
