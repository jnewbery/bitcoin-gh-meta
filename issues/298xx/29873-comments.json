Maybe in the long run the network moves towards a lower cap on transaction sizes and this can be a way to test the waters; on the other hand, if we get this wrong and there is demand for bigger TRUC transactions for some use case, we can always relax the limit later if we need to.",

But we will likely need to transmit more data when we support PTLCs, which means we'll probably reduce the maximum number of allowed PTLCs (IIRC we'll have to divide the current limits roughly by two). That would reduce the maximum size of a commitment transaction, which is IMO a good thing and would likely work with your proposed maximum of 25KvB!\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think you shouldn't care about the size of today's lightning transactions: whenever we start using TRUCs, we can cut down the maximum number of allowed HTLCs to ensure that the transaction size stays below 25KvB. Lightning should adapt to what's best for bitcoin more generally, and I agree that smaller transactions are desirable.",
