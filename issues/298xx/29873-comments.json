Maybe in the long run the network moves towards a lower cap on transaction sizes and this can be a way to test the waters; on the other hand, if we get this wrong and there is demand for bigger TRUC transactions for some use case, we can always relax the limit later if we need to.",

But we will likely need to transmit more data when we support PTLCs, which means we'll probably reduce the maximum number of allowed PTLCs (IIRC we'll have to divide the current limits roughly by two). That would reduce the maximum size of a commitment transaction, which is IMO a good thing and would likely work with your proposed maximum of 25KvB!\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, I think you shouldn't care about the size of today's lightning transactions: whenever we start using TRUCs, we can cut down the maximum number of allowed HTLCs to ensure that the transaction size stays below 25KvB. Lightning should adapt to what's best for bitcoin more generally, and I agree that smaller transactions are desirable.",

Legacy v2 commitment transactions are already opting to RBF, so shall be able to be replaced by v3. This is unclear for the splicing flow, where a counterparty could malleate one of the v2 transaction flow above v3 `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` (no guarantee that one counterparty contributes at least one input and as such sign the splice-in/out).\r\n\r\n> Is this useful for pinning, given that there are already tighter limits on commitment tx size through max_accepted_htlcs?\r\n\r\nYes if you have sane negotiated `max_accepted_htlcs` with your channel counterparties. On the other hand, you have a trade-off with off-chain HTLCs per-channel throughput (only considering non-dust HTLCs) as they wonât materialize on the commitment transaction. In practice, I think itâs really rare when LN nodes are reaching a concurrent `max_accepted_htlcs` of ~10/20 per-channel. It might be better to have a constraining `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` and have them open more pinning relatively hardened channels to scale their off-chain payment throughput (of course, it incentivizes LN nodes to occupy more space in the UTXO setâ¦trade-offs).",

However I think increasing it is also likely to be hard in practice -- if someone designs their protocol assuming an attacker can only attach 9.9kvB of garbage to their 100vB tx, then suddenly finding out that an attacker can actually attach 24.9kvB of garbage instead might cause them unexpected problems (\"now I have to pay 2.5x as much as I'd planned??\") which might break software that had been designed based on the initial parameters.",
