   "body" : "This isn't (easily) doable:\r\n* Qt only officially ships `.tar.xz` or `.zip`. However it's `.zip` artifacts seem to have been generated on a Windows machine? Which means they are polluted with Windows line endings/similar, which break all of our patches. This could possibly be worked around, but is messy / annoying.  The commit here is WIP in that it needs extra handling for all of the tag tarballs being named the same thing. (You can Guix build with `NO_QT=1` to test).\r\n* libxkbcommon has no alternative to [its official `.tar.xz` downloads](https://xkbcommon.org/download/), however I've hacked up the unbootstrapped github tarball to be usable here.\r\n* `native_llvm` still uses `.tar.xz` tarballs (I couldn't find pre-compiled alternatives), however all of that code will soon be deleted.\r\n\r\nPutting that aside, there is a real question of if we want to consolidate all packages in depends to one type of tarball, or another. i.e `.tar.bz2` or `.tar.gz`, meaning we could actually eliminate some deps from Guix.",
