If Commit() is slow and it has to be called more than once, it could make index sync less efficient, even if it blocks validation code less.\r\n\r\nThere's a choice about what to do when the Commit() call at the end of the sync is slow and a new block is connected while it is executing.\r\n\r\n1. Currently, the new block may get ignored and the index could be corrupted.\r\n2. Before 0faafb57f8298547949cbc0044ee9e925ed887ba from [#28955](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28955), and after cbcb2c82669deaad71e739c64b1baf687e76e604 from this PR, cs_main is locked during Commit() so a new block can't be connected.\r\n3. The suggested [diff](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29867#pullrequestreview-2003980602) would call Commit() again and potentially keep calling it until no new blocks were connected.\r\n\r\nI think behaviors 2 or 3 both should be ok in practice, and 3 may be more appealing conceptually because ideally indexes should not hold cs_main and block validation code while writing their own data.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to use approach 3 but only call Commit() exactly once at the end of the sync, skipping subsequent Commit() calls if more blocks are connected until the sync is completely finished and there is a ChainStateFlushed() notification. This would be similar to what happens with normal BlockConnected() notifications for new blocks.\r\n\r\nI think any approach that fixes the bug is fine though, and the current approach does LGTM.",
