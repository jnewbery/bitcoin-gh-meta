However, for the sake of uniformity, I believe it's better to continue listing them as is currently being done.\r\n\r\n> Concept ACK. thanks for opening this! it's easy to forget to update support for service bit filtering here and the list just keeps getting longer.\r\n> \r\n> another possibility could be just mentioning that the seeder supports service bit filtering and linking to the seeder repo to check the exact list of service bits supported. curious to know what other people think.\r\n\r\n",
