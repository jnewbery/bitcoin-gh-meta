For example, the current memory bounds for orphanage is 100KvB * 100 = 40MB, and guaranteeing 1 tx per peer would require reserving a pretty large space.\r\n\r\nLowering `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT` for all txns is not being proposed, as there are existing apps/protocols that rely on large transactions. However, it's been brought up that we should consider this for TRUCs (which is especially designed to avoid Rule 3 pinning).\r\n\r\nThis reduction to 25k should be ok because:\r\n- [Expected size of a commitment transaction](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#expected-weight-of-the-commitment-transaction) is within (900 + 172 * 483 + 224) / 4 = 21050vB\r\n- v3 isn't standard yet, so this wouldn't break somebody's existing use case. If we find that this is too small, we can always increase it later. Decreasing would be much more difficult.\r\n\r\nQuestions we'd want to consider\r\n- Would this make things {broken, inconvenient} for potential users of TRUCs, e.g. by requiring swapping between v3 and v2?\r\n- Is this useful for pinning, given that there are already tighter limits on commitment tx size through `max_accepted_htlcs`?",
