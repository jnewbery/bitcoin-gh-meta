A nice thing about fuzz test is that they can be written to exercise scenarios which go beyond what matters in practice, as more extreme values may trigger bugs more easily (and those bugs may affect realistic cases too, but be harder to trigger there).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, in this case it seems the issue is the code under test not working if the sum of sizes exceeds 2^31. The standard transaction size shouldn't matter for this code, so I'd prefer to restrict to supported cases more directly. E.g. by reading from the fuzzer only sizes in the range (1...2^31-1-sum_of_sizes_so_far) and/or stop adding transactions when the sum of sizes overflows.\r\n\r\nIf that's too hard to do, the current approach is fine of course, but even then, there is no strict need to tie it to standard sizes.",
