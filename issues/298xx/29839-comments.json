It's not required for experienced reviewers since they can easily identify those from context. On the other hand, it might indicate to newbies like me what is most needed and what to pick if I would like to contribute to otherstuff that's in the fringes.\n\nObvious downside is increased bureaucratic effort on repo maintenance.
