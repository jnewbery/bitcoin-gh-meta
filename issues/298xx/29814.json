I phrased as a troubleshooting hint, rather than make it a default recommendation, because:\r\n\r\n1. so far only I ran into it, and fanquake couldn't reproduce\r\n2. BDB is only used for the legacy wallet, which itself is deprecated\r\n3. it seems better to replace as few default tools on macOS as possible\r\n\r\nThe instructions in `build-osx.md` don't even mention depends, so I don't touch those here.",
