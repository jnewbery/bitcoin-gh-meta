   "body" : "I noticed while reviewing #19085, if the wallet is due to perform a [`PeriodicFlush()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aa35ea55021dbb7f35a00fd666903d9fd03b88e7/src/wallet/db.cpp#L650), but in the [2 second delay](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aa35ea55021dbb7f35a00fd666903d9fd03b88e7/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L966), another action occurs, i.e a call to `backupwallet`, the flushing never happens.\r\n\r\nThe wallet does get [flushed and db closed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/wallet/db.cpp#L708) as part of `backupwallet` (remains loaded); however this leaves the scheduler running `MaybeCompactWalletDB` continually trying to flush the wallet, which now always fails because `mapFileUseCount` is empty.\r\n\r\nNote that generally, when `MaybeCompactWalletDB`  is called, nothing is done because:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/aa35ea55021dbb7f35a00fd666903d9fd03b88e7/src/wallet/walletdb.cpp#L966\r\n\r\nis false. However in this case, it's true, and we do continually descend into `PeriodicFlush()`.  \r\n\r\nThis is resolved whenever the next wallet related action occurs, i.e a call to `getwalletinfo`, as `mapFileUseCount` is repopulated, and `PeriodicFlush()` succeeds. \r\n\r\nI don't know the wallet code well enough to know if this is a problem, or just an implementation quirk.",
