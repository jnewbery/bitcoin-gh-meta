      "body" : "I am astonished that as many random memory access as we're making for these things is actually well tuned.   I'd really like to understand how 8 way fanout is optimal, if it is, since that amount of memory latency should significantly slower than e.g. four way fanout into buckets of two esp with caches much larger than L3. Reports were that it wasn't which suggests to me that something is wrong, either in our implementation or in my understanding of the hardware, maybe our hash function is too slow and thats obscuring it.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look at is tuning the eviction/epoch counter part.",

This is because a recently inserted transaction should be close to it's first hash-index and a recently inserted transaction is more likely to be mined.\r\n\r\nIf you want to simulate the worst case you should write a benchmark that tests the cache with a block that has all previously unseen signatures/transactions.",
