Later on you decide to set a password.

So the idea is that the whole wallet is compromised, not just some keys in it. We don't have a good separation between UTXOs/addresses within a wallet. On the other hand we already support multiple wallets, which are completely isolated so there are no chances of leaking/mixing UTXOs and addresses.",
