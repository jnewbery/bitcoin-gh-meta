So an attacker who simply did a straightforward pinning attack on an ephemeral anchor spend could force the defender to spend an additional:\r\n\r\n    20sat/vB * 1000vB = 20,000sat = $8 USD\r\n\r\njust to get their transaction mined, at almost no cost to themselves. We need a better solution than that. One obvious one would be to make the 1000vB limit much smaller, eg the same size as a 2-in, 1 out, anchor spend. A Replace-by-Fee-Rate carveout for this specific case is another potential solution. (and as @ariard mentions, replace-by-fee-rate in general is a solution; IIUC one-shot replace-by-fee-rate will be quite a bit easier to implement with the cluster mempool work)",
