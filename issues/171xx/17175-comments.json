Though I can hardly imagine that it was not done in the course of the introduction of BIP 143, as runtime reduction from O(nÂ²) to O(n) was one of the main points of this. Or is this indirectly tested with some other benchmarks? If yes, what's the point of having separate benchmarks focussing on solely the signature hash? Just asking all this from the perspective of a newbie.",
