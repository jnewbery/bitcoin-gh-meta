This binds correctly, but it seems bitcoind is picking one of them and using that (via Tor control port) for configuration of the target address of the hidden service. This fails, because the wildcard address has a different meaning to the Tor container. To fix this issue, bitcoind could offer a separate configuration option for the target address (which would support hostnames, see below). This issue is tracked in #25094.\r\n2. Use hostnames to bind to a specific external interface, which can be reached via that name or resolved IP from the Tor container. As stated above, bitcoind currently does not support this. I don't get the security argument â it's up to the user to trust their name resolution and configure bitcoind either by hostname or IP as desired.\r\n3. Use fixed numerical IP, which can be reached from the Tor container. However, IPs are typically assigned dynamically (e.g. by Docker). This makes configuration overly complicated, as your workaround clearly shows. For example, Docker containers use arbitrary values in `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/hostname` by default, so your workaround wouldn't work out of the box. I'd rather use `nslookup`, if I were to go that route.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, currently none of the options work with the configuration of a Tor hidden service, managed by bitcoind via control port. Currently I can only revert back to the old method of managing the hidden service in the Tor container.",
