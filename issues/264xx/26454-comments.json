If that's the case, we can't even rebroadcast it unless we somehow store that the transaction needs to be unconditionally broadcast, or we go back unconditionally broadcasting all wallet transactions.

And of course, privacy leaks can be mitigated by occasionally accepting full-rnf replacements.\n\n>> The most likely scenario where this is relevant is congestion. In that scenario the minimum relay fee rate is not going to be the same on all nodes. So your fee bumped transaction genuinely has a higher chance of getting mined. Indeed, your own node may not be accepting the original to the mempool due to a higher than default relay fee.\n>\n>In that scenario, we should be checking the conditions for whether a transaction can be abandoned before allowing fee bumping. In such a situation, the same effect can be achieved by abandoning the transaction and recreating it.\n\nThere is no safe way of recreating a transaction from the user's perspective. The correct thing to do is to feebump to ensure that the recipient isn't paid twice.\n\nCongestion is a transient condition. Not permanent.\n\nIndeed, abandontransaction is a very dangerous RPC call that can easily result in lost money. We should have added a true cancel transaction instead that double spent to avoid a double payment.\n",
