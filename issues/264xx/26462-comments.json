Some sort of db checksum created from one of the wallet encrypted keys might solve tampering attempts in a more general manner. \r\nI'm speaking generally because we most likely have other ways to crash/break the wallet at startup by inserting data directly into the db. Like modifying and/or erasing the wallet flags or the min version field, or changing a spkm type which would crash during the `GetNewDestination` type check assertion.",
