However, it changes this algorithm from O(n) - where `n` is the value of `pinfo->nRefCount` - to O(1). Since this is a simple change, easy to review and test, I supposed it would be interested for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Yet I'm not sure how much of an improvement it will make in terms of efficiency (because I'm not sure how big pinfo -> nRefCount could be).\r\n\r\nBut, there are other instances in the same file where the Left shift is already being used for the same purpose. As a result, I see no point in continuing to use the current iterative method for calculating the power of two. It's better to change it for the sake of consistency and better practice.",
