QT splash screen says \"press q\" but pressing q doesn't do anything, and bitcoind doesn't shutdown with Control+C. Only kill -9 gets the job done.\r\n\r\nI second @glendon144's suggestion that for QT, since the GUI doesn't launch until this process completes, perhaps a block height status should be displayed. If it's rolling forward, display the current height _(the logs show it, so the QT splash screen should be able to)_, and what block height it's rolling forward to _(if possible, not sure about this one)_.\r\n\r\n@somewhatnmc: looking at my logs in real time as I type this, and it appears to go through the blocks at an equivalent pace _(maybe slightly faster)_ to when it was originally validating those blocks.
