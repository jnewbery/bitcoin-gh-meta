   "body" : "Closes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8798\r\n\r\nUse case: I run a full node that accepts inbound connections and have a `whitebind` setting so my personal light client can always connect, even when `maxconnections` (and particularly all inbound slots) is already full.\r\n\r\nCurrently when connections are full, if we receive an inbound peer request, we look for a current connection to evict so the new peer can have a slot. To find an evict-able peer we go through all our peers and \"protect\" multiple categories of peers, then we evict the \"worst\" peer that is left unprotected. If there are no peers left to evict, the inbound connection is denied.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if the inbound connection has `forceinbound` permission we start the eviction process by first protecting all `noban` and outbound connections, then selecting one of the remaining peers (if any) at random. Then we loop through all our current connections, removing protected peers from the evict-able list. If we end up protecting all our remaining connections, the randomly chosen peer is evicted.\r\n\r\n`forceinbound` implies `noban` permission.\r\n\r\nAll outbound and `noban` connections remain protected from eviction.",
