      "body" : "Had a chat with @sdaftuar offline about how safe this RPC is for a miner to expose. He gave an example of a \"parent pays for child\" package that is currently handled poorly, and a small fix to prevent it. I've added the small fix and a test that contains an example.\r\n\r\nImagine a diamond shape and mempool minfeerate is 5sat/vB:\r\n```\r\n     grandparent\r\n       5650sat\r\n        5649vB\r\n     /    |    \\\r\n  parent1 |   parent2\r\n13223sat  |   13223sat\r\n  191vB   |   191vB\r\n       \\  |   /\r\n        child\r\n       2424sat\r\n        485vB\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn master, what we'll do is reject each individual transaction, but end up accepting the full package. The child is just below the mempool min feerate and is likely to be evicted later in `TrimToSize()`, but doing so pushes the min feerate up by 1sat/vB and leaves the grandparent + parents in the mempool. Each of the parents' ancestor packages have low block selection scores but the grandparent's descendant package looks pretty good. Maybe one day we'll eliminate the asymmetry between selection and eviction... but basically our problem here is allowing the parents to pay for the child in the first place.\r\n\r\nYou can perhaps submit the same transactions via `sendrawtransaction` if `-maxmempool` is very large and the min feerate is lower. However, the fact that this pushes mempool min feerate up makes this worse than what you can do without it - the mempool will start rejecting anything between 5-6sat/vB afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe small change is to reject any package in which the child has a lower feerate than the package feerate. So we reject all of the transactions.",

Of course this PR only allows acceptance of a package over rpc, but at least it would allow miners to open up an alternative endpoint for vulnerable lightning node operators to submit their packages to.\r\n\r\nShort answer: I don't know of any issues with the \"child-with-parents tree only\" topology. It was actually made specifically for Lightning.\r\n\r\nThe current RPC is restricted to child-with-parents topology. However, it doesn't work for all child-with-parent packages as it doesn't handle parents spending each other properly. This is one of the reasons it was regtest-only. This, among other things, was going to be fixed in #26711, after which it would be ok to build the p2p changes (and thus make sense to submitpackage outside of regtest).\r\n\r\nGiven current events, multiple people reached out about a miner opening up submitpackage to make \"package relay without the relay\" available for lightning today. So I made this PR, thinking it was \"good enough\" for this use case and RPC is a trusted interface anyway. But after talking through the edge cases more with others, particularly about a miner opening this as a public API, I became convinced that this is unsafe and we should wait until #26711. It didn't seem right to quickly add commits that avoided specific edge cases, as there are just so many of them. #26711 would not make sense to rush or backport.\r\n\r\nBut I already opened this PR, so I wanted to at least push a branch that I don't believe is unsafe. Hence the \"tree only\" which avoids the edge cases but covers Lightning since AFAIK you won't make commitment transactions that spend each other. I do not recommend running a patch, but if you decide to do so, use this branch with trees only.",

The upside is that the edge case is identified at that point.\r\n\r\nBut also this is only a theoretical possibility, because it might be that there are no edges cases with \"child-with-parents tree only\"? Not sure if this is provable somehow. If there would be an edge case, I think it would need to be filtered out by #26711 (assuming that PR fixes it all). Maybe that is a way to come up with that edge case - try to find a \"child-with-parents tree only\" that would pass this PR, but not be able to pass the validation in #26711? When looking at #26711 though, it seems that with testing all sub-packages, it is only relaxing things rather than restricting it further compared to this PR.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to share two other thoughts:\r\n* Perhaps more unexpected problems emerge for the more generic \"all child-with-parent packages\" fix, further delaying the deployment of `submitpackage` for lightning use cases.\r\n\r\n* I think that the availability of `submitpackage` outside of regtest is a trigger for lightning devs to start looking at it more seriously and consider the implications for node implementations. It may not be completely trivial to use the new rpc, because the nodes might need to keep track of packages internally and this may require refactors. By kicking off that process, it can continue in parallel with further ironing out the other topologies on L1 rather than being blocked on it.\r\n\r\n  Same for miners. I think it is advantageous if their thinking about package acceptance is started sooner rather than later. These benefits may outweigh the slight uncertainties that still surround this PR. ",

Every time we think about it a bit longer, another not-quite-ideal edge case comes up. Especially with full mempools and eviction being something to consider.\r\n\r\nI think this should have remained as a separate PR, and should have been okay to merge as-is, rather than adding only loosely-related commits to #26711. Two reasons:\r\n\r\n - after #26933 this doesn't allow any problematic behaviour that would not have also been achievable without this patchset, simply by having received the txs in a different order (eg, by sending you the individual txs in the package immediately when your node restarted, after it had connected to p2p but before it had finished loading the mempool)\r\n - it's an experimental rpc; if people using it hit problems occasionally, that's okay.\r\n\r\nYes, there are definitely edge cases and possibly problematic behaviour, but there's already lots of that in the mempool, and there's nothing here that's particularly scary.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think we should be encouraging miners to expose this prior to the rest of the package relay work; and given #26933 this doesn't really provide any benefits over just having a large enough mempool that you're not evicting transactions in the first place, and running getblocktemplate against that.
