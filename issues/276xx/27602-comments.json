I haven't got my head around how to properly compute what are the odds of this happening though, given it feels like it depends on how often `MEMPOOL` messages are sent to us, which may be unbounded (how many `MEMPOOL` requests can we receive in a `UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY` period, and how full our mempool may be?). In any case, this feels detrimental for the peer implementing this behavior instead of for us (?)\r\n\r\nSomething I'm really wondering is why this is actually bound by `INVENTORY_MAX_RECENT_RELAY (3500)`  instead of by `MAX_PEER_TX_ANNOUNCEMENTS (5000)`. It feels quite inconsistent that we are able to accept up to 5000 transaction announcements from someone but we are only able to remember the last 3500 that we have announced to someone(else).\r\n\r\nI think what may make even more sense would be to reply to mempool messages only with transactions that fall into the `txinfo.m_time <= now - UNCONDITIONAL_RELAY_DELAY` check, that way we don't really have to add transactions to `m_recently_announced_invs` here, and we are also discouraging peers bloating us with `MEMPOOL` messages. As long as they have a filter set, any transaction that matches their filter will be announced to them anyway (h/t @sdaftuar). I guess this could be done as a followup if it makes sense.",

If we are already trusting the peer that sends use MEMPOOL message, why not just include everything we've got?\r\nA practical counter-argument to this could be - yeah but at this time [around 20% to 30% of reachable nodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27426#issuecomment-1529678174) set `peerbloomfilters` so it's still worth closing an obvious fingerprinting vector.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is whether it's breaking any usecase. Since the message is from a trusted peer a client may be relying on getting the whole mempool. For instance BTCPay/NBXplorer needs `whitelist=mempool` iirc. What's the proportion of announced vs non-announced transactions? How much would be left out with this patch?",

In the replacement scenario which @ajtowns is describing. Timing of entry of replacement == notfound of replaced tx. With `mapRelay`, since you have the replaced tx for 15 minutes, you'll still serve it instead of immediately saying notfound. But `mapRelay` is useless against this if the spy node just waits 15 minutes before doing the replacement. So this could just be a lost cause.\r\n\r\nAnyway, will take this to #27625 instead.",

If we are already trusting the peer that sends use MEMPOOL message, why not just include everything we've got? A practical counter-argument to this could be - yeah but at this time [around 20% to 30% of reachable nodes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27426#issuecomment-1529678174) set `peerbloomfilters` so it's still worth closing an obvious fingerprinting vector.\r\n\r\nWe still do. This is not modifying the behavior of the announcements that result from a `mempool` message, but the behavior of the node to the `getdata` messages that may follow. Before the patch, a node was able to send us a `mempool` message and, from that point on, request any transaction from our mempool (even if we haven't announced that to them at all).\r\n\r\n> \r\n> Another thing is whether it's breaking any usecase. Since the message is from a trusted peer a client may be relying on getting the whole mempool. For instance BTCPay/NBXplorer needs `whitelist=mempool` iirc. What's the proportion of announced vs non-announced transactions? How much would be left out with this patch?\r\n\r\nAs of [27c40e3](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27602/commits/27c40e3dcf280a137bcfaa787674c26781d911b8) we still do, even though I would argue that, by doing this, we are encouraging peers to spam us with mempool messages instead of waiting for us to announce the transactions that match their filters in due time.\r\n\r\n",

This PR changes both Case1 and Case2, but Case1 is only about things happening in the same second.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI meant regarding the time checks in master, the checks were indeed protecting against querying something that was in the mempool before the mempool message was received. Meaning that while this patch fixes the issues around requesting data after a mempool message is received, they are not as severe as initially assumed.\r\n\r\n> However, I agree with @ajtowns's concern raised above about blowing up `m_recently_announced_invs`. That bloom filter has size 3500 and if we put 300k elements in it, then it is probably not going to work as expected. Approach NACK due to that.\r\n\r\nI think at this point there are two easy solutions to the problem (with their corresponding tradeoffs, of course):\r\n\r\n1. Do things as stated in the patch but guarding addition to the `m_recently_announced_invs` rolling filter by checking that the data we are adding is not older than two minutes, as @ajtowns originally suggested. This will prevent us from adding data that will be served unconditionally anyway, reducing the odds of overflowing the filter. However, I'm not sure how AJ computed the odds of the filter overflowing due to high traffic, so I'm not able to convince myself this is enough.\r\n\r\n2. Keep the `m_recently_announced_invs` bypass as it is in `master`, but do check the bloom filter when deciding whether to relay something that may have been announced to a peer as a response to a `mempool` message. This has two main drawbacks: \r\n\r\n- First, we will be checking the filter twice, once when deciding whether to include the transaction announcement as part of the response to the `MEMPOOL` message (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L5649-L5651) and again as part of the combined check in `FindTxForGetData` (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/src/net_processing.cpp#L2271).\r\n- Second, this, potentially, can result in the two versions of the filter differing between them. A node could clear their filter after sending the `MEMPOOL` message and before requesting the data and we will end up serving something we haven't really announced. However, I cannot think of a proper use case (or attack, FWIW) that takes advantage of this in a meaningful way. If the goal was for us to include all the data we had in our mempool when sending us the `MEMPOOL` message, they could have had a clear filter to begin with. \r\n\r\n",
