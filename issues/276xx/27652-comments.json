But this would only be the case if the user _doesn't_ specify a peer.\r\n\r\nIt would also need a progress indicator, which our RPC doesn't really offer. The debug log can of course be used for that. Or you could go all fancy and have the node track the status of the block fetch, including the ability to cancel it.\r\n\r\nThe upside is that it can fix the weird quirk that we disconnect from any peer that fails to deliver the block. This is because net_processing works under the assumption that we only ask blocks from peers that told us they have it, so if they don't deliver we assume there's a problem with the peer. But if we try the next peer before this timeout, `BlockRequested` clears the in flight map and no timeout will occur. Well, except for the last attempt.\r\n\r\nYou could also request the block from all peers at the same time, but not without a major refactor (more than #27626 probably).\r\n\r\nFor the pruned node case @furszy is working on things are potentially a bit simpler. All of our non-pruned peers should have the block. That means the user wouldn't need to specifify a peer and instead we can just pick _one_.\r\n\r\nYou could implement that special case for the `getblockfrompeer` RPC:\r\n1. if the user doesn't specify a peer and the block is not an ancestor of the tip, fail with \"must specify peer when fetching a stale block\"; otherwise\r\n2. pick a random non-pruned node and fetch it (fail if we only have pruned peers)",

Notes taken.\r\n\r\nI started implementing this in a separate class `BlockRequestTracker` with its own scheduled task to detect the timeout and re-try + follow the requests progress (which also involves listening to the node disconnection signal). But, agree that can also add it to the `FindNextBlocksToDownload` existent mechanism as well.\r\nCould merge both worlds and slowly start decoupling the block downloading logic into a separate module while continue using the `SendMessages` thread to detect timeouts and queue requests.\r\n\r\n> For the pruned node case @furszy is working on things are potentially a bit simpler. All of our non-pruned peers should have the block. That means the user wouldn't need to specifify a peer and instead we can just pick one.\r\n\r\nWell, peers could delay the response or directly not answer. Stalling the post-filter-matching blocks sync mechanism. So, we also need a blocks tracking module in that branch too.",
