See [OpenVPN](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/blob/master/net-vpn/openvpn/files/openvpn-2.1.init) for an example of another service that starts up in the inactive state and [calls back](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/blob/dd1ebe44dd72ec2435687095d063644ec94d8b8e/net-vpn/openvpn/files/up.sh#L93-L94) into OpenRC later when the service is fully up and running. OpenVPN performs the callback from a script that the daemon spawns after establishing the VPN tunnel. That's how I originally implemented it for Bitcoin Core too, using the `-startupnotify` option, but I was told to use `-daemonwait` instead, so now the callback happens from a backgrounded subshell after `bitcoind` forks into the background.\r\n\r\n> (Also, nit, would prefer to keep the command variables?)\r\n\r\nThe default `start()` function, which uses those variables, doesn't support marking the service inactive at startup or forking a subshell to the background. I could rewrite my `start()` in terms of those variables if you really like to see the variables, but I think that's more confusing than inlining the values directly in the function.\r\n\r\nDo you have any other ideas for how to fix the problem? To remind: the problem is that, using the currently shipped runscript, the `bitcoind` service reaches the `started` state despite not actually being ready to accept RPC requests from dependent services. OpenRC then starts dependent services, which immediately fail because `bitcoind` refuses their RPCs. The most straightforward solution is simply to add `-daemonwait` to the command line, but you (@luke-jr) expressed a concern about that potentially holding up the boot process for an unacceptably long time, so I addressed that concern with the background hack.\r\n\r\nAre we just going to concede that the problem is unsolvable?",
