Coming from #27652.\r\n\r\nThe general idea is to keep track of the user requested blocks so, in\r\ncase of a bad behaving peer or a network disconnection, they can be\r\nfetched from another one automatically without any further user interaction.\r\n\r\nThis was requested by users because the `getblockfrompeer` RPC command\r\nlacks the functionality to notify them about block request failures or peer\r\ndisconnections (which is expected due to the asynchronous nature of the block\r\nrequests).\r\n\r\nCurrently, this new functionality is limited to blocks requested by the\r\nuser via the 'getblockfrompeer' RPC command.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this class could expand its scope and be utilized in the\r\nregular chain synchronization process. Or, even could be employed in\r\nspecial procedures like a prune node rescan that uses BIP158 block filters,\r\nor even into BIP157 itself.",
