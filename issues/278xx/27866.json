   "body" : "The goal of this PR is to establish that fatal blockstorage flush errors should be treated as errors at their call site.\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch `FlushBlockFile` may have failed without returning in `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, leading to a potential write from `WriteBlockIndexDB` that may refer to a block that is not fully flushed to disk yet. By returning if either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile` fail, we ensure that no further write operations take place that may lead to an inconsistent database when crashing. Add `[[nodiscard]]` annotations to them such that they are not ignored in future.\r\n\r\nFunctions that call either `FlushUndoFile` or `FlushBlockFile`, need to handle these extra abort cases properly. Since `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` already produces an abort error in case of `WriteBlockIndexDB` failing, no extra logic for functions calling `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk` is required.\r\n\r\nBesides `Chainstate::FlushStateToDisk`, `FlushBlockFile` is also called by `FindBlockPos`, while `FlushUndoFile` is only called by `FlushBlockFile` and `WriteUndoDataForBlock`. For both these cases, the flush error is not further bubbled up. Instead, the error is logged and a comment is provided why bubbling up an error would be less desirable in these cases.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis pull request is part of a larger effort towards improving the shutdown / abort / fatal error handling in validation code. It is a first step towards implementing proper fatal error return type enforcement similar as proposed by theuni in this pull request [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27711#issuecomment-1563561502). For ease of review of these critical changes, a first step would be checking that `AbortNode` leads to early and error-conveying returns at its call site. Further work for enforcing returns when `AbortNode` is called is done in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27862.",
