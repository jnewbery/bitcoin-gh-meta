It includes a patch with a couple changes I've upstreamed:\r\n* https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4668\r\n* https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/4670\r\n\r\nI also noticed the CMake Windows version autodetction was broken with mingw-w64 (https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/4669), so we set the version explicitly. The Windows build was also broken without `-DZMQ_HAVE_IPC=OFF`, so just set that for now (it's not clear if this is a bug in the build system, or should be fixed in the src, will follow up).\r\n\r\nAs part of this change we move cmake-minimal in Guix into the global package set.\r\n\r\nBased on https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29706.",
