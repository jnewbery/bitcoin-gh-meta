So they'd require a ppa as well, see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27510.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if two third-party PPAs  are more stable than a vanilla Ubuntu, but I won't object a pull request that implements the changes.

Even if it were to break, and people didn't run the tests locally, and missed it, it should not be too hard to fix them after the temporary disable.",
