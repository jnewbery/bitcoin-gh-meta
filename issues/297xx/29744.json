   "body" : "Motivated by a [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29479#pullrequestreview-1957109397) in #29479, this draft PR rewrites the `lint-include-guards.py`, `lint-includes.py`, and `lint-spelling.py` linters in Rust.\r\n\r\nThe only expected change in behavior is that the include guards lint now prints all missing include guards before exiting. \r\n\r\nPart of the motivation for this PR is reusing `fn get_pathspecs_exclude_subtrees`. I can see reasons why the benefits of this PR might be outweighed by the downsides so I'm just publishing this as a draft to explore if further rewriting the lint suite in rust is desirable, and if so, what the best approach is.\r\n",
