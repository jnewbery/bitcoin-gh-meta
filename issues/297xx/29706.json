   "body" : "Set `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib/` and `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON` globally in depends, rather than per-package. `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib/` is needed to override the annoying [`GNUInstallDirs`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html) `lib` vs `lib64` behaviour, and we always want PIC code. The PIC commit is the counterpart to the same Autotools change in #29488. I'm PRing these commits as I have a CMake branch building on top, and want to avoid adding the same workarounds to every package we are going to touch, but these can go in separately as the build should be tested for existing packages (i.e multiprocess).",
