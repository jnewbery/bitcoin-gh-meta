   "body" : "Fixes https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18614\r\n\r\nPreviously, `wait_for_getheaders` would check whether a node had received **any** getheaders message. This implied that, if a test needed to check for a specific block hash within a headers message, it had to make sure that it was checking the desired message. This normally involved having to manually clear `last_message`. This method, apart from being too verbose, was error-prone, given an undesired `getheaders` would make tests pass.\r\n\r\nThis adds the ability to check for a specific block_hash within the last `getheaders` message.\r\n\r\n",
