This implied that, if a test needed to check for a specific block hash within a headers message, it had to make sure that it was checking the desired message. This normally involved having to manually clear `last_message`. This method, apart from being too verbose, was error-prone, given an undesired `getheaders` would make tests pass.\r\n\r\nThis adds the ability to check for a specific block_hash within the last `getheaders` message.\r\n\r\n",
