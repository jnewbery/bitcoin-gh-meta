   "body" : "This is based on #29668 and will be taken out of draft status once that is merged.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we check that `BLOCK_HAVE_DATA` is available for all blocks an index needs to sync during startup. However, for `coinstatsindex` and `blockfilterindex` we also need the undo data for these blocks. If that data is missing in the blocks, we are currently still starting to sync each of these indices and then crash later when we encounter the missing data.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds explicit knowledge of which block data is needed for each index and then checks its availability during startup before initializing the sync process on them.",
