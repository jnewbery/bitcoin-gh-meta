For example by having an environment variable to indicate which check to run. For example `LINT=subtree cargo run` to run `lint_subtree`, and `LINT=help` to print all LINT tests.\r\n\r\n> The `lint_all` function also doesn't actually run all linters anymore with this change, it only runs the python ones\r\n\r\nI don't think this has changed. The linters written in bash were never run as part of \"lint all\", for example `git-subtree-check.sh` or `test/lint/commit-script-check.sh`. Also, `test/lint/check-doc.py` (written in python) was never run as part of \"lint all\".\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think more important than the choice of language is to actually fix the issue that was intended to be solved.

For example, `crypto/ctaes` is a subtree, but `test/lint/lint_ignore_dirs.py` does not list it. Also, `test/lint/lint-locale-dependence.py` and `test/lint/lint-python-utf8-encoding.py` don't use `test/lint/lint_ignore_dirs.py`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if I am missing something. If the issue is indeed fixed, this pull request can clearly be closed.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it seems better to close this pull request and start a fresh one, if needed, which clearly explains the issue/problem in its own words, and how it is fixed. I don't think the discussion in this pull request, and the fact that the patch changed after opening,  makes it  easy to follow.",
