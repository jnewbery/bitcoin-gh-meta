   "body" : "This PR updates copyrights from 2023 to 2024 for \"The Bitcoin Core developers\" and \"Bitcoin Developers\" while leaving copyrights for other entities alone. It also standardizes the use of copyrights as there were approximately 20 files that said \"-present\" while hundreds said \"-2023\" or another end year that hadn't been updated. Although this is a trivial change, a significant number of files were edited, so please thoroughly review before merging. I double-checked every edit I made but would appreciate your feedback.\r\n\r\n2024 is here and we're less than a month away from the halving!",
