Have you tried it?\r\n\r\nYes, I have tried to recreate this bug with the original `feature_assumeutxo` test from #29767, but simply sleeping between setting `m_synced` and `Commit()` cannot trigger it. I've attempted to recreate the data race by only pause Sync thread after it set `m_synced` and before it call `FlatFileSeq::Open`, this trigger data race when run `feature_assumeutxo` test with a probability of around 10%. \r\nThis is my way to recreate it: 5931fb8f0966f435e9b975ee1c4c4357e88e9e56. I am pretty sure there will be a better solution, but I can only come up with this one for now.\r\n",

The `BaseIndex::BlockConnected` notification thread was never locking `cs_main`. So setting `m_synced = true;` before calling `Commit();` was always unsafe, even with `cs_main` held because the `BlockConnected` thread could run in parallel and both threads could try to update index state at the same time. #28955 would make the race more likely to happen though, which was probably why it was caught more recently.",
