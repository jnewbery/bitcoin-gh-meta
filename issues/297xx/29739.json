   "body" : "These tools are used in GUI packaging on macOS, and also somewhat of a blocker for #21778. The main issue is that some distros don't really ship these tools in a standard ways, i.e Ubuntu only ships `llvm-otool` with a version suffix, i.e `llvm-otool-17`, which makes it hard to find and use. Rather than trying to deal with that mess, switch to using the equivalent LLVM counterparts:\r\n`otool` ->`llvm-objdump`\r\n`install_name_tool` ->` llvm-install-name-tool`\r\n\r\n`install-name-tool` might still be an issue in future, given it also ships with a suffix on Ubuntu, but for now, switch to the LLVM tool, given we are able too, and want to remove reliance on cctools.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, remove `dsymutil`.",
