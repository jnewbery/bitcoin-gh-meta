   "body" : "Feerate comparisons in the recently (#29242) introduced `FeeFrac` type rely on multiplications between 32-bit and 64-bit integers. On 64-bit systems, hardware can do this natively. On GCC and Clang we can use the `__int128` type for this, but on MSVC one needs to use the `_mul128` or `_mulh` intrinsics instead. This PR adds these.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this code myself, though it's based on similar code in libsecp256k1 (see https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/blob/v0.4.1/src/int128_struct_impl.h#L7L30).",
