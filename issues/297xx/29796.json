Depends currently uses `-O1`, while `--enable-debug` will set `-O0`.\r\n* `-O0` is unusable in various ways:\r\n    * Compiling certain assembly under `-O0` doesn't currently work: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29407#issuecomment-2027843446 (probably an upstream issue?).\r\n    * Windows cross-compilation at `-O0` is broken without additional flags: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28109. \r\n\r\nI'm not completely sure yet what the right choice is (previously it seems that `-Og` was unusable with Clang? (note that for Clang it looks like `-Og` and `-O1` are basically equivalent), but we should at least align the two systems to be using the same thing for debugging.\r\n\r\nConfigure history:\r\n`-O0` added in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/3833\r\nSwitched to `-Og` in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13005.\r\nSwitched back to `-O0` https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16435\r\n\r\nDepends `DEBUG=1` mode has used `-O1` since inception.",
