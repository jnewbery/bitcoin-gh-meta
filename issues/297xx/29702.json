   "body" : "Coupling the fees serialization with CLIENT_VERSION is problematic, because:\r\n\r\n* `CLIENT_VERSION` may change, even though the serialization format does not change. This is harmless, but still confusing.\r\n* If a serialization format change was backported (unlikely), it may lead to incorrect results.\r\n* `CLIENT_VERSION` is changed at a different time during the release process than any serialization format change.\r\n* It is harder to reason about a global `CLIENT_VERSION` when changing the format, than to reason about a versioning local to the module.\r\n\r\nFix all issues by pinning the current version number in the module locally. In the future it can then be modified locally to the module, if needed.",
