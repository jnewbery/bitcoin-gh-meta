I am a [macOS codesigner](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-detached-sigs/pull/34) and was able to sign a guix-built `bin/bitcoind` release as well as create a detached signature like we do for the gui. However I did so with the Apple-blessed tools (OS keychain and `codesign` command). I was also unable to re-attach that signature to the binary which would be required for guix attestations. So the work involved here would mostly be patching https://github.com/achow101/signapple by @achow101 to operate on flat binaries in addition to bundled packages like Qt, and then in this repository, just updating the guix build/sign/release docs with a few extra steps.",
