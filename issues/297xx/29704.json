   "body" : "The new `p2p_handshake` test requires that limited nodes are not peered with when the node's system time exceeds ~ 24h of the node's chaintip timestamp, as per [`PeerManagerImpl::GetDesirableServiceFlags`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ffaa927023f5dc2a7b8d6cfeb4f4810e573b18c/src/net_processing.cpp#L1717).\r\n\r\nBy patching this test to modify the timestamp of the chaintip as opposed to mocking the node's system time, we make it resilient to future commits where the node raises a warning if it detects its system time is too much out of sync with its outbound peers.\r\n\r\nResolves a silent merge conflict in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/29623, that is changing the warning behaviour when significant time differences with outbound peers are detected, [failing the test as it's currently in master](https://cirrus-ci.com/task/6553996884705280?logs=ci#L4666).\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderations/alternatives I've thought of:\r\n- could add `self.setup_clean_chain = True` to `self.set_test_params()`, to avoid creating a new tip with a (much) older date, but it doesn't seem to matter?\r\n- could avoid using `setmocktime` altogether and instead use [`create_block`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2ffaa927023f5dc2a7b8d6cfeb4f4810e573b18c/test/functional/test_framework/blocktools.py#L68) instead, but that seems like it'll be a lot more verbose and I don't think it's worth it?\r\n\r\nBig thanks to @theStack for his time in discussing this with me offline.",
