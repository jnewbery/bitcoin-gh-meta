      "body" : "When resetting a test chain, it is also important to consider the script interpreter coverage of the current chain. Test chains are (usually) the first place to go to, to test new script primitives and protocols, as well as consensus deployments. The existing chain thus serves as a test for consensus implementations, apart from basic unit test vectors. It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain. See also https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/11739#issuecomment-346515145 . Or if it is not needed, it would be good to say so. Maybe https://github.com/bitcoin-core/qa-assets/blob/main/unit_test_data/script_assets_test.json already covers a good portion?\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop. Recall that policy is enforced on all networks equally (see commit e1dc15d69061e69351c72907444e8ded0ac7c88c), so getting a non-mempool transaction into a block is only possible for a miner, or by cooperating with a miner. So if the difficulty hack is removed completely, anyone wishing to submit a transaction would have to go purchase and set up mining hardware, or find a miner willing to accept the transaction. Not saying what is the best approach here, just saying that the effects should be considered and a change be done intentionally.",

I am experimenting with some of the proposals from the mailing list and so I added Andres Poelstra's suggested difficulty adjustment with 6h/1M from here: https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/9bL00vRj7OU/m/kFPaQCzmBwAJ\r\n\r\n> Probably we should support tracking both testnet3 and the new testnet4 for some time. Making the new code conditional on a different chain param that's only set for testnet4 would probably be the easiest way of accomplishing that?\r\n\r\nUpdated the code to introduce T4 (`-testnet4`) and keep T3 in place but give some deprecation warning when it's used. I guess we would keep this in place for 1 or 2 releases and then remove T3 and then let `-testnet` run T4.\r\n\r\nI am using the Genesis block hash to distinguish between the two testnets. There may be cleaner solutions but I think this is ok since it would be only temporary until T3 is removed.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, testnet is the only public chain where anyone can submit a nonstandard transaction from their laptop.\r\n\r\nIs it really realistic that someone with just their CPU would be able to mine a block with their non-standard tx on the current testnet? If the bug isn't active currently they would need to wait for it to become active and that could take weeks, right? And when it becomes active I would imagine the miner who found the first block in the difficulty=1 series just blasts the network and the CPU miner still has no chance to get a block in between. \r\n\r\nWe could revert #28354 for testnet4 if this is a feature that matters to users. Is it too much to ask that people use `testmempoolaccept` or run their own testnet node with `-acceptnonstdtxn=0` when they want to test standardness of their tx? I would say no. And I don't see another option to solve this on layer 1 if we assume nobody changes the defaults.\r\n\r\n> It would be good to think how to preserve the test vectors in the chain.\r\n\r\nInteresting thought. I think once there is consensus to do T4 we will find a creative solution for this. Cool would be to convert this coverage to fuzzing coverage somehow but I am not sure if that's realistic or worth the effort. Otherwise, we could write a program that looks at all the different scripts that exist on T3 and replays them on T4 or if we can compress them somehow like by filtering everything that doesn't add coverage, then we turn it into a unit test that replays the interesting scripts.",

This would allow the network to return to the organic difficulty in fewer difficulty periods and slow down the blockstorms but not remove the feature altogether. My understanding is that this would correspond roughly a tenth of one S9 mining on the network, so if no one had mined for a while, a single S9 could restart the network with ~60â¯s blocks, but wouldnât churn out thousands of blocks per second.\r\n\r\nOnly allowing lower difficulty blocks after 6 hours could easily make testnet useless for extended periods, if someone put several ASICs on testnet for a while, it might prevent other users from getting confirmations for up to 6 hours. I could see an increase from the twenty minute rule to maybe an hour, but more seems counter to why the rule was introduced in the first place.",

All you have to do is to set the time +20min and mine a block on your laptop. If you don't want to try it yourself, you can come by to watch it on my laptop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> Since some people consider the blockstorms an interesting feature of Testnet3\r\n\r\nAfter a quick chat with @murchandamus, an alternative fix would be to require the pre-retarget block to have the \"correct\" difficulty, so that all retarget periods are organic. The +20min hack would remain to allow a CPU to mine a few blocks, if needed, however, a block storm would be naturally limited by the +120h cut-off rule. This would limit the block storms to small block \"gusts\", which seems good enough to make everyone happy?",
