   "body" : "Put the generic parts from `StaticContentsSock` into a separate class `ZeroSock` so that they can be reused in other mocked `Sock` implementations.\r\n\r\nAdd a new `DynSock` whose `Recv()` and `Send()` methods can be controlled after the object is created. To achieve that, the caller/creator of `DynSock` provides to its constructor two pipes (FIFOs) - recv-pipe and send-pipe. Whatever data is written to recv-pipe is later received by `DynSock::Recv()` method and whatever data is written to the socket using `DynSock::Send()` can later be found in the send-pipe. For convenience there are also two methods to send and receive `CNetMessage`s.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is used in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26812 (first two commits from that PR).\r\nExtracting as a separate PR suggested here: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/30043#discussion_r1619152037.",
