Also included in this PR is a temporary bump to 2.2.8 to verify that it builds correctly. I'm happy to revert that and discuss the bump separately, as miniupnpc bumps require some scrutiny.~\r\n\r\nI believe that this is problematic if we build against one version and encounter a different one at runtime. This is not a problem for depends because we build statically. But for users who are self-building against shared system libs, care must be taken to run against the same version used for linking.\r\n\r\nSome quick digging shows that at least Ubuntu/Arch make the distinction between soversions:\r\n`libminiupnpc.so.17` -> `libminiupnpc.so.18`. So in practice, I suppose this shouldn't be much of a problem.\r\n\r\nBoooo for the upstream loose abi policy.",
