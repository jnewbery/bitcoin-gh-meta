   "body" : "@0xB10C : reviving this old discussion from some two years ago:\r\n\r\n              @rob-scheepens agree that BPF CO-RE and libbpf is the way to go for future tracing programs. I've looked into this a while ago, but it seems libbpf doesn't support USDT tracepoints yet (see https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/3007). However, there was a mention of a soon to be open sourced libusdt library developed and used in production at Meta by @anakryiko [here](https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/CAEf4BzYRLxzVHw00DUphqqdv2m_AU7Mu=S0JF0PZYN40hBvHgA@mail.gmail.com/). Looking forward to testing this once available!\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @0xB10C in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/22006#issuecomment-1072538909_\r\n            \r\nNow that USDT has been implemented it would be great to give this a try. In this context, I also came across https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/4404, which could help make things easier.",
