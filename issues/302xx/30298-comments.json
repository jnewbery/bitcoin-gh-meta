      "body" : "I've been extensively using libbpf (& the libbpf-rs Rust crate) with the Bitcoin Core USDT tracepoints in https://github.com/0xB10C/peer-observer. I would be happy to see the tools being ported and would help to review a port.  That being said, the tools (`contrinb/tracing/*`) could also be extracted to a `tracing-tools` repository to be maintained (and tested against Bitcoin Core) there.\r\n\r\nMore important than the tools is IMO an elegant way of getting rid of the bcc Python dependency, which has been troublesome, start and using libbpf in our tests. I'm not aware of Python bindings for libbpf (but haven't tried to look for them).\r\n\r\nGiven that there seem to be a lack of reviewers (or interest) for tracing related PRs (e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26593, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25832), I'm not planning to start porting it myself anytime soon.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use the SystemTap macros to insert tracepoints. I think the x84_64 support of libbpf for these is good, aarch64 might not be fully ready yet (https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/issues/796). But I don't think there are many people using the tracepoints on aarch64 (besides myself).\r\n",
