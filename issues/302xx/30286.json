   "body" : "Depends on #30126.\r\n\r\nThis improves the candidate search algorithm introduced in the previous PR with a variety of optimizations.\r\n\r\nThe resulting search algorithm largely follows Section 2 of [How to linearize your cluster](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/how-to-linearize-your-cluster/303#h-2-finding-high-feerate-subsets-5), though with a few changes:\r\n* Connected component analysis is performed inside the search algorithm (creating initial work items per component for each candidate), rather than once at a higher level. This duplicates some work but is significantly simpler in implementation.\r\n* No ancestor-set based presplitting inside the search is performed; instead, the `best` value is initialized with the best topologically valid set known to the LIMO algorithm before search starts: the better one out of the highest-feerate remaining ancestor set, and the highest-feerate prefix of remaining transactions in `old_linearization`.\r\n* Work items are represented using an included set *inc* and an undefined set *und*, rather than included and excluded.\r\n* Potential sets *pot* are not computed for work items with empty *inc*.\r\n\r\nAt a high level, the only missing optimization from that post is bottleneck analysis; my thinking is that it only really helps with clusters that are already relatively cheap to linearize (doing so would need to be done at a higher level, not inside the search algorithm).\r\n",
