For Erlay purposes, some transactions need to be sent via fanout even to Erlay-enabled peers. In order to know to how many peers to send this via fanout, we need to count the amount of tx-relaying peers that we have, both inbound and outbound.\r\n \r\nThis is done, in the current patch, by going over all peers when constructing their corresponding INV message and deciding whether to add the transaction or not (this requires accesing the `CNodeState`, which involves locking `cs_main`). In the new revision, this would be done in `PeerManagerImpl::RelayTransaction`, and two sets will be kept, per peer, one for fanout and one for reconciliation. \r\n\r\nTL;DR; checking if a peer is inbound from the `PeerManager` perspective should not require locking `cs_main`",
