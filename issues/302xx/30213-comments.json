Currently the `V1Transport` and `V2Transport` implementation figure that out. They also perform all the additional steps to construct a `CNetMessage`.\r\n\r\nIn my initial attempt here I moved some of that work to `CNode`, but it's a mess.\r\n\r\n> and a layer \"command-based transport\" interface on top\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean here, but I guess we'd want some new class that tells `Transport` how many bytes to fetch and hands off a `CNetMessage` to `CNode::ReceiveMsgBytes`?",
