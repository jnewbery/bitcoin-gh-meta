   "body" : "This is similar to (but does not fix) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/13155 which I believe is the same issue but in libevent.\r\n\r\nThe issue is on a host that has IPV6 enabled but only a loopback IP address `-proxy=[::1]` will fail as `[::1]` is not considered valid by `getaddrinfo` with `AI_ADDRCONFIG` flag. I think the loopback interface should be considered valid and we have a functional test that will try to test this: `feature_proxy.py`.\r\n\r\nTo replicate the issue, run `feature_proxy.py` inside a docker container that has IPV6 loopback ::1 address without specifically giving that container an external IPV6 address. IPV6 on loopback interface was enabled in docker engine 26 and later ([https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.0/#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-2](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/26.0/#bug-fixes-and-enhancements-2)).\r\n\r\nAI_ADDRCONFIG was introduced to prevent slow DNS lookups on systems that were IPV4 only. I think most systems will be dual stack now and I'm not sure this is really a concern for us but this is something to consider as a potential downside of this PR.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nMan section on AI_ADDRCONFIG:`\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then IPv4 addresses are returned in the list pointed to by res only if the local system has at least one IPv4 address configured, and  IPv6  addresses\r\n       are  returned only if the local system has at least one IPv6 address configured.  The loopback address is not considered for this case as valid as a configured address.  This flag is useful on, for exâ\r\n       ample, IPv4-only systems, to ensure that getaddrinfo() does not return IPv6 socket addresses that would always fail in connect(2) or bind(2).\r\n```\r\n\r\n[AI_ADDRCONFIG considered harmful Wiki entry by Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Networking/NameResolution/ADDRCONFIG)\r\n\r\n[Mozilla discussing slow DNS without AI_ADDRCONFIG and also localhost issues with it](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=467497)\r\n",
