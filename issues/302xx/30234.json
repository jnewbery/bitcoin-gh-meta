Though these appear to have been harmless, adding the check avoids the copy in the self-assignment case so there should be no downside.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, minisketch failed the check as well. See https://github.com/sipa/minisketch/pull/87\r\n\r\nAfter fixing up the violations, turn on the aggressive clang-tidy check.\r\n\r\nNote that I only locally tested bitcoind sources. It's possible that additional fixups are required for tests/fuzzers/etc. We'll see what c-i thinks.\r\n\r\nNote for reviewers: `git diff -w` makes this trivial to review.",
