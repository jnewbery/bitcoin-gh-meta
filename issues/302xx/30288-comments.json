      "body" : "> This is not what currently happens, but simplest approach might be for the original chainstate to be unaffected by the snapshot chainstate, and to continue to download and attach the same blocks it otherwise would have if no snapshot were loaded. It would just do it more slowly due to a reduced cache size and lower priority for block requests compared to the snapshot chainstate.\r\n\r\nI think that the concept of the Active Chainstate / Active Tip is important for this this discussion. Currently, it is tied to the snapshot chainstate until the background sync has finished.\r\nIf we keep that logic, having the background chainstate target the most-work block doesn't really achieve anything - if that chain turns out to be valid, we would still never use it for anything meaningful because the snapshot chainstate will remain the active one.\r\nSo in order for targeting the most-work chain to make any sense, we'd also need to introduce the possibility of switching the active chainstate to it without the requirement that the background sync has to finish. Which would lead to other questions: I we don't prioritize syncing the background chainstate towards it anymore, should we keep the now-unused snapshot chainstate around indefinitely and just ignore it exists? Should we be able to switch the active chainstate back to the snapshot chain in case we receive more blocks building on top of it, so that it becomes the most-work chain again?\r\n\r\nConsidering that AssumeUtxo sync is meant to be an optional and temporary optimization, and that large reorgs should be very infrequent, it could also make sense to abandon the AssumeUtxo sync, delete the snapshot chainstate and revert to normal sync as soon as we accept a header on a different chain that has more work than the best header of the snapshot chain.\r\n\r\nI think that pragmatically we shouldn't accept a snapshot in the first place if it's not an ancestor of the most-work header `m_best_header` (I plan on opening a PR for that soon), but that doesn't solve the problem completely because we might only learn about another chain after having loaded the snapshot successfully.",
