If the ephemeral anchor-having transaction had non-0-fee, that would allow endogenous incentives to get it mined on its own, leaving the dust in the utxo set. As an example from the LN spec, [trimmed outputs(https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/03-transactions.md#trimmed-outputs) are directly added to the commitment transaction fee. Instead, spec writers could have the value flow to the ephemeral anchor, which is then spent to fees by the child transaction. Example spec here: https://github.com/instagibbs/bolts/commits/zero_fee_commitment\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly narrow motivation, and honestly I don't love the timmed output to fees scheme, but also doesn't make the code anymore complicated, so I think it's worth consideration.\r\n\r\n",
