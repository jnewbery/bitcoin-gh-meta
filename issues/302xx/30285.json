The first running from back to front, the second from front to back.\r\n\r\nThe `MergeLinearizations(depgraph, linearization1, linearization2)` function computes a new linearization for the provided cluster, given two existing linearizations for that cluster, which is at least as good as both inputs. The algorithm is described at a high level in [merging incomparable linearizations](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/merging-incomparable-linearizations/209).\r\n",
