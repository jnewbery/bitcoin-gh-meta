   "body" : "At the moment, the eviction logic is mangled across two different components (`CConnman`, `PeerManager`), so we can't really test it in isolation. This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net.{h.cpp}` for which tests already exist. However, the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits out the eviction logic into its own component `EvictionManager`. In addition to isolating the eviction logic, we get rid of several layer violations (e.g. `CConnman::ForEachNode/ForNode` calls, `CNode::m_last_block_time`, etc.) between `net` and `net processing`.\r\n\r\nOne instance of the `EvictionManager` is created at start up and passed as a reference to the connection and peer managers. The connection and peer managers report all eviction relevant information to the eviction manager who ultimately suggests nodes to evict as the result of `EvictionManager::SelectInboundNodeToEvict` and `EvictionManager::SelectOutboundNodesToEvict`.",
