And in that case, as I mentioned above, I'd also request that the commits in the 2nd pull request would immediately use the new functionality as it's added as opposed to adding it all, then switching it all in the end. To do that, I suspect that many of these current commits will need to be combined/dropped/re-worked. If that's the case, don't worry about git attribution or trying to use the original commits, I don't care about that at all :)",

      "body" : "> Is it possible to contextualize the benefit of this relatively large refactor?\r\n\r\nI would say this PR is similar to #21148, #19988 or #787 in that it splits some logic (e.g. tx request, orphan handling) into its own component (some of the mentioned PRs also changed behavior which this PR does not), which is good for modularity and testability. At the moment, the eviction logic is mangled across two different components (CConnman, PeerManager), so we can't really test it in isolation. This is not completely true for the inbound eviction logic as it exists as static functions in `net` but the outbound eviction logic is not covered by any fuzz tests and is only testable by spinning up both a connman and peerman.\r\n\r\nI also think that isolating this logic will make it easier to reason about potential future changes to it.\r\n\r\nThe layer violation resolutions are more of a nice side effect and I should have mentioned/stressed the test/fuzz benefits in the PR description.\r\n\r\n> If this is, for example, more testable, wouldn't it make sense to bundle the added test coverage with these changes so that potential reviewers are able to see the tangible benefit?\r\n\r\nGood idea i will add some fuzz and isolated testing for the outbound eviction logic. \r\n\r\n> Is there some broader effort that this is part of?\r\n\r\nPinging @theuni for this question and to see if he has more to add here in general since this was originally his work.\r\n",

As it stands, in order to evict a peer, we need to gather the current states of several otherwise-unrelated things. Not only is this slow and error-prone (real-time locking for each individual state capture), it also makes the eviction logic impossible to reason about (and test) on its own.\r\n\r\nSo the solution/pattern that's emerged to untangle similar problems in the past is: rather than doing real-time peeks into required subsystems every time we need to do something, instead broadcast the triggering events to a new subsystem that maintains a full view of whatever it needs. In practice, what this means is a producer/consumer pattern where multiple subsystems are notified when _something_ happens, and it's up to each to decide what to do with those changes. Yes, this may mean that several subsystems hold duplicate values for the same thing, but now they don't have to cross over each-other for a full view.\r\n\r\nEventually these patterns could be formalized into something like the signals/slots we have elsewhere, which has the nice side-effect of defining triggers that other subsystems may be interested in as well. But as a first step, imo just untangling the layer violations is a worthy goal.",
