I added the args stuff because I was  investigating performance for a target that creates a new TestingSetup each iteration. The argsman setup with all arguments actually was one of the slower things (among block tree db, chainman setup and blockfile creation).\r\n\r\n> And if you want to construct a PeerManager for each fuzzing iteration, it seems too slow either way, unless you find a way to skip the memory allocations (as you said yourself).\r\n\r\nAfaict the allocations are mostly due to one or two large bloom filters. I think we could lazily initialize the filters on demand, so executions that don't reach code that use the filters would benefit. Or alternatively, we could allow to set the size of these filters when creating a peerman (i think that would be fine for tests).",

Stubbing the latter out gives us control over testing net processing behavior related to these adjacent modules by being able to mock their behavior and state.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't fuzz the other modules, just that it makes more sense to do in isolation for the type of fuzzing we currently utilize. We can also fuzz the integration of them all but snapshot fuzzing is probably much better for that due to quite heavy initial state requirements (I have been working on this as well using https://nyx-fuzz.com/).\r\n\r\n> The possible behaviour of an individual p2p message in isolation? The p2p protocol state machine for a single peer?\r\n\r\nYes and yes, each would be its own target. Another example would be the processing of a sequence of messages e.g. a target per protocol flow we are interested in testing: version handshake, compact block relay, tx relay, etc. All of this can happen for a single peer or multiple.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

After #27675 there's only a single trivial `LOCK(m_mempool.cs)` left in net_proc, so I think it would just be a bunch of search-and-replaces to abstract those out? That seems like it would be handy for stubbing, but also make it a lot clearer what parts of validation/mempool are actually needed by net_processing, which might help with reducing `cs_main` or otherwise cleaning up validation/mempool?",
