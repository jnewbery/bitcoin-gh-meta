If a nice canonical lib ever emerges we could always jump to it, as there are only a few basic functions and presumably we could probably switch them out close to 1:1.\r\n\r\nThat said, it is a little rough to review as\r\n- It needs to be compared to the letter of the spec, with the assumption that @laanwj is evil or has mis-implemented (I doubt that :)\r\n- It needs to be very defensive, though the attack surface seems quite minimal\r\n- It needs to be aware of real-world violators/benders/extenders of the spec (if any? I have no idea.)\r\n\r\nBut it seems worth the effort to me.",
