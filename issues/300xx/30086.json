Using such strings as currency to measure value is not as good as using a certain indicator in the current development of artificial intelligence to act as a digital currency, measure value, and empower the development of artificial intelligence. It is recommended to replace traditional meaningless digital currencies and redefine and develop digital currencies using a certain indicator in the training of artificial intelligence generation models or a certain indicator during the operation of artificial intelligence.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\nno\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nUsing such strings as currency to measure value is not as good as using a certain indicator in the current development of artificial intelligence to act as a digital currency, measure value, and empower the development of artificial intelligence.
