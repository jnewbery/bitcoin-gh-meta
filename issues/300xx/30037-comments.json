      "body" : "Great find!\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable and safer to increase the min prune target, since blocks can be larger post-segwit (and we've seen it, e.g. 774628).  Some rough napkin math for a new value (correct me if something looks off):\r\n- 4MB per block, 288 blocks = 1152MB\r\n- Add 15% for Undo data = 1325MB\r\n- Add 20% for Orphan block rate = 1590MB\r\n- Add one block file + added 15% undo data = 147MB\r\n- Target >= 1737MB, so something like 1750MB seems at first glance that it could work\r\n\r\nI would recommend we minimize impact to existing nodes and provide time for warning/deprecation.\r\n>increase the limit in a hard way - this would be an inconvenience to lots of existing users who would need to update their bitcoin.conf to be able to start bitcoind\r\n\r\nThis seems like a no-go to me as it can impact node runtime.  An alternate option is presented below\r\n\r\n>increase it in a soft way, something like disrepecting it on purpose by setting it to a higher value, but without an init error.\r\n\r\nThis seems at minimum unintuitive and at most dangerous for node operators, since nodes with limited space would believe bitcoind was being limited/constrained to a particular allocated amount of space but would be exceeding the allocated amount.\r\n\r\n>add a comment to the -prune doc that values around 550MiB are pointless.\r\n\r\nYes, this seems prudent.\r\n\r\n>do nothing\r\n\r\nWe should do something, as this seems like a bug given current allowed block sizes.\r\n\r\nHow about something like:\r\n- Temporarily allow and respect values >= 550MB but < 1750MB (e.g. for one release)\r\n- bitcoind provides a warning message for values >= 550MB but < 1750MB\r\n- Add a clear deprecation warning in the release notes\r\n- Add note/comment for `prune` in the default bitcoin.conf and `-prune` help/doc about values >= 550MB but < 1750MB being supported temporarily but unsupported in future release\r\n- In a future release, the min prune target can be changed to and enforced to 1750MB",
