This is the recommended way to run the linters, as it avoids differences that may occur due to different versions of dependencies installed on your local system, and the need for changes like this.\r\n\r\n> since recent releases of lief\r\n\r\nAs LIEF mostly exists here for the type stubs, I don't think there's a reason to diverge it from the version we use in Guix (0.13.2), if things are working fine.",
