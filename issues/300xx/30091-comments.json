Since the maximum difficulty increase is 4x, the block rate will be at most 4x faster than normal, ie 2m30s instead of 10m. Setting --min-nbits is saying \"I don't need the difficulty to increase\" which implies just mining a block every 10 minutes is fine since the chain starts at a difficulty matching min nbits.\r\n\r\nThe fast mining of the initial 100 blocks is achieved by backdating block number one by 100 times the block interval (so 250 minutes if blocks are 2.5m apart), then mining blocks timestamped at regular intervals until it catches up with the current time.\r\n\r\nYou probably don't want 600s mining time -- you'll be constantly using 100% cpu across all cores in that case. Mining time is how much CPU you use once difficulty has reached your desired level, not how long the time is between blocks.",

The 6th one would run at about 7m46s per block; for a total of ~28 days to ramp up the difficulty.
