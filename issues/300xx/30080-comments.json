      "body" : "Thanks for the feedback! I agree that it is worth considering how to make these parameters more useful for general users.\r\n\r\n> `change_target` IIUC you want a specific min value for the change UTXO. Would a following alternative work? You provide your change address in the list of recipients with desired min amount and specify it as change UTXO using `change_position`parameter. The downside compared to a new option is that we always have a change output. Not sure if that's a problem in your case.\r\n\r\nAlways having a change output would be a problem because we always prefer a changeless tx if the excess is not too large. But when that is not possible the change should be large enough to potentially spend later as a changeless tx.  \r\n\r\nA possible alternative would be to add a setting for CHANGE_LOWER rather than always use the hard coded value of 50,000 sats. It is probably not necessary for my use case to set the `change_target` every time we fund a tx; we can just make sure it is always above the minimum value we want for all of our UTXOs.\r\n\r\n> `disable_algos` This makes sense, and could be a first step to pluggable coin selection in core. But it should be in settings, not in RPC parameters. I doubt many users need to change it at runtime and so it's better to keep the RPC parameters to a minimum.\r\n\r\nI agree that generally it's too in the weeds for most users. I'll move it to settings.\r\n\r\n> `add_excess_to_recipient_position` This options seems like a compromise that makes nobody happy. From your perspective you're okay to overfund a channel, but you have no control by how much, since excess is not configurable. From the perspective of users not doing splicing, this option is not useful at all.\r\n\r\nGood point. The maximum excess currently built into BnB is `cost_of_change`, defined as the cost to create and spend a change output. This is an arbitrary value to use if you are happy to add some amount of excess to a changeless spend output. It would be better to also have a `max_excess` parameter that defaults to `cost_of_change` if not otherwise defined.\r\n \r\n> It seems like what you really want is to search for a changeless solution in a given target range. And then if failed to fallback to a solution with change.\r\n\r\nExactly! I believe that is how CS works now. If no set of inputs are found with excess in the range from zero to `cost_of_change` then BnB will fail and CS will fallback to a solution with change. But adding a new `max_excess` parameter would make it explicit what that range is.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of not over complicating the coin selection options, do you think it would be better to have two new options: `add_excess_to_recipient_position` and `max_excess`, OR just add `max_excess` and always default to add the excess to the first spending target?",
