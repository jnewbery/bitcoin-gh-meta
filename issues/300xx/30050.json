This PR refactors `CreateTransactionInternal` to:\r\n\r\n* Get the serialized size directly from the `CRecipient`: this sets us up in a future PR to calculate the serialized size of silent payment `CTxDestinations` (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28201/commits/797e21c8c1bf393e668eeef8bb7ee9cae1e5e41e)\r\n* Use the new `GetSerializeSizeForRecipient` to move the serialize size calculation to *before* coin selection and the output creation to *after* coin selection: this also sets us up for silent payments sending in a future PR in that silent payments outputs cannot be created until after the inputs to the transaction have been selected\r\n\r\nAside from the silent payments use case, I think this structure logically makes more sense. As a reminder, move-only commits are best reviewed with something like `git diff -w --color-moved=dimmed-zebra`\r\n",
