This is partially caused by the lack of documentation plus non-intuitive variable naming (which was more intuitive when fewer things were accounted for, but\r\nhasn't aged well). This has led to this accounting being error-prone and hard to maintain (as shown in the first commit of this PR).\r\n\r\nRedefine some of the constants, plus document what are we accounting for so this can be extended more easily\r\n\r\nFixes #18911\r\n",
