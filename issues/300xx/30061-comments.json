Even if all userspace things would be statically linked, you're still relying on your kernel for example. And it turns out that for interacting with graphics subsystems of your operating system, dynamic libraries are practically the only solution, as statically-linked ones would pretty much only work on the exact system they were compiled for.",

There's only a few functions used from that library, for a specific purpose (multiple monitor support), if the library can't be loaded, it can be assumed that this functionality isn't needed. This does mean patching Qt though. Basically to set `hasXinerama()` to be false in that case.\r\n\r\n)i've handled the xcb/wayland switch in that way--if X libraries can't be found, don't exit, but fail loading the XCB platform and go on to the next one\r\n\r\nEdit: But given that you've already had to install X libraries on your system to be able to use X in the first place, the additional security risk of installing another component is negligible, i don't think this is really a pressing issue.",
