Memory usage goes up ~100 MB for each call.\r\n\r\nThe original reporter is repeatedly hitting the rest endpoint and eventually OOM'ing.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nMemory should be freed after a response is sent, or be capped at some point to prevent an OOM.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nObserve bitcoind memory usage in top. Do `getblock <blockhash> 2` and observe the memory usage increase. It fairly reliably reproduces, but does not always occur. Different blocks seem to have different effects, and repeating a block does not always increase usage.\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nCompiled from source\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv27.99.0-eb0bdbdd753b\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
