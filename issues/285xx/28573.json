   "body" : "Instead of figuring out the commit *after* the last merge and rebasing on that with a ~1 suffix, just figure out the last merge commit directly and rebase on it. This way, if HEAD happens to be a merge commit, the rebase just succeeds immediately without blank variables or errors.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28497#issuecomment-1743430631:\r\n\r\n> The problem is that the PR only contains a one commit after the last merge, so the job _should_ be skipped, but the `pull_request.commits != 1` check is not smart enough to skip it because the PR is based on another PR and has merge ancestor commits. So specifically what happens is that after HEAD~ is checked out, the new HEAD  is a merge commit, so the range `$(git log --merges -1 --format=%H)..HEAD` is equivalent to HEAD..HEAD, which is empty, so the `COMMIT_AFTER_LAST_MERGE` variable is empty and the rebase command fails.",
