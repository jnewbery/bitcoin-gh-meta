   "body" : "Bitcoin Core has `secure_allocator`, which allocates inside special \"secure\" (non-swappable) memory pages, which may be limited in availability. Currently, every `CKey` object uses 32 such secure bytes, even when the `CKey` object contains the (invalid) value zero.\r\n\r\nChange this to not use memory when the `CKey` is invalid. This is particularly relevant for `BIP324Cipher` which briefly holds a `CKey`, but after receiving the remote's public key and initializing the encryption ciphers, the key is wiped. In case secure memory usage is in high demand, it'd be silly to waste it on P2P encryption keys instead of wallet keys.",
