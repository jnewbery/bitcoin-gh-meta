I think this is confusing to users that have never even thought about using assumeutxo since in that case the rebalancing is just ensuring the normal environment with one chainstate. So I suggest we don't log in absence of a snapshot chainstate. We could also think about rewording the message instead but I think this is simpler.\r\n",
