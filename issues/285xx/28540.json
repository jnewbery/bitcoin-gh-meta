We don't care about this property, just that the child is continuously replaced until we observe it's position in mapWallet is before its parent. Instead of using bumpfee, we can create raw transactions which have only pay the additional incremental relay fee, thus avoiding this problem.\r\n\r\nFixes #28491",
