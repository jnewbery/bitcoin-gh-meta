   "body" : "The benchmark conducted locally showed a ~65% processing time reduction, on a SSD.\r\nResults can be found at the end of the description.\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Description:\r\nThe current wallet migration process performs only individual db writes. Accessing disk to\r\ndelete all legacy records, clone and clean each address book entries for every created wallet,\r\ncreate each new descriptors (with their corresponding master key, caches and key pool), and\r\nalso clone and delete each transaction that requires to be transferred to a different wallet.\r\n\r\nThis work consolidates all individual disk writes into two batch operations. One for the descriptors\r\ncreation from the legacy data and a second one for the execution of the migration process itself.\r\nEfficiently dumping all the information to disk at once atomically at the end of each process.\r\n\r\nThis represent a significant speed up and also a consistency improvement. During migration, we\r\neither want to succeed or fail. No other outcomes should be accepted. We should never leave a\r\npartially migrated wallet on disk and request the user to manually restore the previous wallet from\r\na backup (at least not if we can avoid it).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since db transactions relevant to key pool generation were also batched, this work\r\nalso speeds up the regular wallet creation process.\r\n\r\n#### Note for Testers:\r\nThe first commit introduces a benchmark for the migration process. This one can be\r\ncherry-picked on top of master to compare results pre and post changes.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the benchmark setup may take some time (~70 seconds here) due to the absence\r\nof a batching mechanism for the address generation process (`GetNewDestination()` calls). Which,\r\nI plan to address in a separate PR, just to not continue expanding this PR.\r\n\r\n#### Final Notes:\r\nThis PR is intended to be an \"all-in-one\" solution that's ready for use and testing. In the coming days, \r\nwill start breaking it down into smaller, focused PRs for better manageability and review.\r\n\r\nââââââââââââââââââââââââ\r\n\r\nBenchmark on master (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:-----------\r\n|   65,093,884,958.00 |                0.02 |    0.0% |     65.09 | `WalletMigration`\r\n\r\nBenchmark on this branch (debug mode)\r\n|               ns/op |                op/s |    err% |     total | benchmark\r\n|--------------------:|--------------------:|--------:|----------:|:----------\r\n|   22,926,814,750.00 |                0.04 |    0.0% |     22.93 | `WalletMigration`",
