With this change, going through `m_tx_inventory_to_send` will be more predictable and reactive, making the tx relay smoother.\r\n\r\nI also checked that the `catch up` code introduced in 5b3406094f2679dfb3763de4414257268565b943 still makes sense. (I think the commit message from there better be in the code because the `division by 1000` is not trivial).\r\nI think catching up will become slower in the case when `m_tx_inventory_to_send` is around 1,000,000; but I think it's fine.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI also want to note that it's not exactly the relay rate, it's the rate of going through the queue.
