   "body" : "`MarkConflicted` assumes that `m_last_block_processed_height` is always valid. However it may not be valid when a chain is not attached, as happens in the wallet tool and during migration. In such situations, when the conflicting height is also negative (which occurs on loading when no chain is available), the calculation of the number of conflict confirms results in a non-negative value which passes the existing check for valid values. This will subsequently hit an assertion in `GetTxDepthInMainChain`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, `MarkConflicted` is also only called on loading a transaction whose parent has a stored state of `TxStateConflicted` and was loaded before the child transaction. This depends on the loading order, which for both sqlite and bdb depends on the txids.\r\n\r\nWe can avoid this by explicitly checking that both `m_last_block_processed_height` and `conflicting_height` are non-negative. Both `tool_wallet.py` and `wallet_migration.py` are updated to create wallets with a state that triggers the assertion.\r\n\r\nFixes #28510",
