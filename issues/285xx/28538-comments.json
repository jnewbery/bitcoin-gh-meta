If for some strange reason we wouldn't be able to find any other peers we wouldn't end up connecting the only ones we have. But I think we would want to start evicting if we are at the limit (so in `CheckForStaleTipAndEvictPeers`), not just if we have exceeded it (`EvictExtraOutboundPeers`).\r\n\r\n> Also, doing the check repeatedy would mean that we could keep blocks-only peers while we're doing IBD, only dropping them when we exit IBD and start caring about tx relay.\r\n\r\nDo we really want that? The main reason to run in `-blocksonly` mode is to save traffic. I would assume that most nodes wouldn't enable listening anyway, but those that do (maybe not even on purpose), maybe it would be nicer not to use them for IBD?",

You seem to care specifically about those users which do `-blocksonly` and forget to disable inbounds. Perhaps this is better communicated through documentation and logging.
