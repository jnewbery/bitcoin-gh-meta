Otherwise itâs quite impossible to provide a sound technical review of the primitives robustness and trade-offs and state what they enable exactly. And it sounds weâre good to repeat the loop of the last 3 or 4 years of covenants discussions.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, just to take the last example of channel factories, most of the folks who have done *real* research on the subject still disagree on the security model and fundamental trade-off of the proposed design of channel factories.\r\n\r\nAs one of my technical peer challenged on the [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-September/020921.html) few months ago:\r\n\r\n\"So I think that means that part of the \"evaluation phase\" should involve\r\nimplementing real systems on top of the proposed change, so that you\r\ncan demonstrate real value from the change. It's easy to say that\r\n\"CTV can enable vaults\" or \"CTV can make opening a lightning channel\r\nnon-interactive\" -- but it's harder to go from saying something\r\nis possible to actually making it happen, so, at least to me, it\r\nseems reasonable to be skeptical of people claiming benefits without\r\ndemonstrating they're achievable in practice.â\r\n\r\nIâm fully sharing this opinion.",
