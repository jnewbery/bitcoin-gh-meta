It's easy to say that\r\n\"CTV can enable vaults\" or \"CTV can make opening a lightning channel\r\nnon-interactive\" -- but it's harder to go from saying something\r\nis possible to actually making it happen, so, at least to me, it\r\nseems reasonable to be skeptical of people claiming benefits without\r\ndemonstrating they're achievable in practice.â\r\n\r\nIâm fully sharing this opinion.",

A theoretical description of a use case that contemplates all scenarios is worth a million times more.\r\n\r\nAlso it's a weird inverted criteria to say that a proposal that enables 20+ use cases is considered _worse_ because it only has ~5 actually implemented (because that's only 25%) while some a proposal that has (say) 1 use case is considered better just because it has that single use case implemented (100%). It should be the opposite. By that rationale every new use case someone comes up with for a proposal now counts negatively against that proposal?",
