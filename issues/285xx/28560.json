In order to do that, SFFO logic needs to be moved out of `FundTransaction` up to the RPCs.\r\n\r\nAs a secondary motivation, this PR moves the SFFO stuff closer to the caller, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.\r\n\r\nI'm also not convinced we need to pass a full `CMutableTx` object to `FundTransaction`, but I'm leaving that for a follow-up PR/discussion.",
