      "body" : "After re-thinking on this issue, in my opinion it's **correct** to send the requested block (if it exists) to a `NoBan` peer here.\r\n\r\nThe `NoBan` permission is designed to augment the Peer with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Can't be banned/disconnected/discouraged for misbehavior\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which I would expect to include the \"misbehaviour\" of requesting blocks past the `NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED` threshold.\r\n\r\n- Changing this to the `Download` permission would have minimal practical impact, as `NoBan` [implies `Download`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/62f7f59ff495fbcbfc10c25e97bb0dc032647abf/src/net_permissions.h#L37).\r\n- Disconnecting a `NoBan` peer should be avoided if possible, and I don't think this specific misbehaviour feels strong-enough to override that guarantee.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining alternative is to ignore the request but _not_ disconnect the `NoBan` peer. In this case the remote node will eventually consider _us_ stalling (after a timeout) and disconnect from us, which again achieves the opposite of the intention of the `NoBan` permission. If we are going to to this we may as well save everyone the time and disconnect the `NoBan` peer right away.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be to leave this code as-is and close this issue out; what do you think @luke-jr ?",
