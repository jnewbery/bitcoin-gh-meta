For example, `TxDownloadOptions` could be extended to hold a lambda that returns the latest tip hash, which in production simply fetches the hash from the `ChainstateManager` (and for tests it can be mocked). This might be easier to review since it preserves the previous mechanism? Although perhaps also more difficult w.r.t to lock inversion of `cs_main` and `m_tx_download_mutex`.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to directly pass the current block hash as a param into the relevant `TxDownloadManager` methods.",
