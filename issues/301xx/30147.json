   "body" : "Closes #30145.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves two major issues in the `parse_version_string` function of verify-binaries:\r\n1. `-aarch64` binaries cannot be specifically downloaded. The -platform string gets interpreted as a release candidate that doesn't exist due to containing sub-string \"rc\".\r\n2. Specifying a platform with a \"-\" in the name causes the parser to ignore both \"-platform\" AND \"-rcN\" and download the potentially wrong (non-rc) version for every platform. This also prevented specifying just one platform binary the user wished to download.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the accompanying `test.py` to cover problem two and adds two examples that were formerly broken to `README.md` to show what is now possible. Including the most useful case of downloading only 1 specific platform's binary.\r\n\r\nThis improves the Bitcoin verify-binaries tools user experience by not:\r\n1. Failing to download for inexplicable reasons,\r\n2. Downloading more files than what the user told it to, or in the worst case\r\n3. Downloading only the wrong files.\r\n\r\n* A test was added to cover the command `verify-binaries/verify.py pub 22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz` which checks that _bitcoin-22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz_ downloads successfully AND ONLY _bitcoin-22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz_ downloads.\r\n* The steps to reproduce each bug are in the referenced issue #30145. Explanation of the potential issue as well as reasoning for the way the bug was fixed are in my commit descriptions.\r\n* This delivers the promised feature of \"only download the binaries for a certain platform\", by allowing strings with '-' to be accepted, allowing for single file downloads for any specific platform which was not always possible before.\r\n* Removes 6 lines of code from the offending `parse_version_string` function, while fixing the bugs/errors, and extending the functionality to be practical for users with slow connections.\r\n* Makes the error message more helpful when no file matches the provided platform string, now prints \"Did you mean: `closest-match`\" to help correct typos.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my PR. I look forward to getting this helpful tool in its best shape yet.\r\n\r\nLog of this branch passing the new test.py:\r\n```\r\npython3 test.py\r\nâ 'Nonexistent version should fail' passed\r\nâ 'Malformed version should fail' passed\r\nâ '--min-good-sigs 20 should fail' passed\r\n- testing verification (22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)\r\nâ '22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz should succeed' passed\r\n- testing verification (22.0)\r\nâ '22.0 should succeed' passed\r\n```\r\n\r\nLog of master failing the new test.py:\r\n```\r\npython3 test.py\r\nâ 'Nonexistent version should fail' passed\r\nâ 'Malformed version should fail' passed\r\nâ '--min-good-sigs 20 should fail' passed\r\n- testing verification (22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz)\r\nâ '22.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz should succeed' passed\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ben/Documents/GitHub/bitcoin/contrib/verify-binaries/test.py\", line 74, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"/home/ben/Documents/GitHub/bitcoin/contrib/verify-binaries/test.py\", line 27, in main\r\n    assert len(v) == 1\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nAssertionError\r\n```",
