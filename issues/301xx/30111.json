Later this should become the mutex guarding `TxDownloadManager`.\r\n  - `m_txrequest` doesn't need to be guarded using `cs_main` anymore\r\n  - `m_recent_confirmed_transactions` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n  - (not done in this PR) `m_orphanage` doesn't need its own lock anymore\r\n- Adds a new `ValidationInterface` event, `UpdatedBlockTipSync`, which is a synchronous version of `UpdatedBlockTip`.\r\n- Flush `m_recent_rejects` and `m_recent_rejects_reconsiderable` on `UpdatedBlockTipSync` just once instead of every time `AlreadyHaveTx` is called. This should speed up calls to that function and removes the need to lock `cs_main` every time it is called.",
