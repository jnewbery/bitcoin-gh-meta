This code is working fine for all other platforms but that does not mean the code is perfect.\r\nWhen I wrote this benchmark, I was probably more concerned about the number of files the benchmark could open in parallel than the delays/inaccuracies introduced by the, OS dependent, directory removal line. Essentially, we shouldn't be removing a directory within the benchmarked code scope.\r\nBut yeah, np on splitting this in two well described commits.",
