It isn't a good single source of information.\r\n\r\nCorrect. The rationale behind this set of changes can be summed up briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n- Add a new standalone modular fee estimation manager to which (many) `Forcasters` can be trivially added or removed (vs modifying `BlockPolicyEstimator`).\r\n- Provide two forcaster implementations which do not exist today ( 1. mempool-based and 2. previous-6-blocks-seen-in-mempool) to demonstrate functionality.\r\n\r\nIn the present, there is a strong tendency for users of Bitcoin Core to consult external fee estimation services when they want timely (next 1 or 2 blocks) confirmation of transactions, whilst also not overpaying. Examples of these include mempool.space, whatthefee.io, Samourai's [nextblock.is](https://blog.samourai.is/introducing-nextblock-fee-estimator/) (now down), [johoe](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,1w,weight), [blockchair](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) etc., with more popping up every month.\r\n\r\nWe also analysed/estimated Bitcoin Core users not using in-built estimation in a post [here](https://hackmd.io/@kEyqkad6QderjWKtcBF5Hg/cChallengies-with-estimating-transaction-fees).\r\n\r\nIn our opinion having users feel the need to use external fee estimation services that they could equally have served to them by their own node, feels sub-optimal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, when users do use the current Bitcoin Core fee estimator, there are often times when they end up overpaying, see delving bitcoin post [Mempool based fee estimation](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703) and various issues over the years e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/30009 . This is avoidable.\r\n\r\nWork from a student of @renepickhardt [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/12) demonstrated something we also measured independently -- that bitcoin core's current estimates are often overpaying significantly following fee spikes. This effect can be directly mitigated by using a mempool-based estimation.\r\n\r\n>  Perhaps it is a good idea to use it as a secondary source, but probably it should only ever adjust fee estimations upward, not down.\r\n\r\nIn this changeset we take the approach of using the lowest result from all \"confident\" `Forcasters`. The rationale is that we expect users wanting fast confirmation to have RBF enabled, allowing them to bump fees if we still undershoot.\r\n\r\nComments from @harding [link](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/mempool-based-fee-estimation-on-bitcoin-core/703/6) explained that it may be possible for miners to _artificially_ increase a strictly-mempool-based fee-rate. By taking the lower (confident) result from `n` `Forcasters`, we attempt to protect against this attack (and others like it), at the potential cost of having to RBF.\r\n\r\nWe do plan to add additional sanity checks to the mempool-based Forcaster as described in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27995, but these are not yet implemented. In any case, even without these additional checks we have been seeing much-improved short time-scale estimations from Bitcoin Core.",
