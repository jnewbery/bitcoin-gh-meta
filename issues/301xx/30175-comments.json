Forcing users to learn how to craft a descriptor when they merely want to watch an address seems overwhelming to me. -> #27034 maps `importaddress` to `addr()` and `raw()` descriptors. And #28307 fixes and extends `createmultisig`/`addmultisigaddress`.\r\n\r\nNot sure about `importprivkey` as it would clash with the new `void(KEY)` descriptor (#29136). The intent there isn't clear enough to me. Perhaps we could create a `importkey` or `importwalletkey` command where the user can input any type of key and specify its intent in one of the command arguments. Personally, I think the `combo()` descriptor should be more of a last-resort fallback that requires a warning, rather than the user's first choice, as it does not support newer output types.\r\n\r\n",
