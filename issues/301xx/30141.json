   "body" : "The validation caches are currently setup independently from where the rest of the validation code is initialized. This makes their ownership semantics unclear. There is also no clear enforcement on when and in what order they need to be initialized. The caches are always initialized in the `BasicTestingSetup` although a number of tests don't actually need them.\r\n\r\nSolve this by moving the caches from global scope into the `ChainstateManager` class. This simplifies the usage of the kernel library by no longer requiring manual setup of the caches prior to using the `ChainstateManager`. Tests that need to access the caches can instantiate them independently.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis pull request is part of the [libbitcoinkernel project](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27587).",
