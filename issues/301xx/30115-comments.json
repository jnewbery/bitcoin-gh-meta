UniValue copies are reasonable in many cases, but our use of them often lends itself to moving.

(There was a `DISABLE_IMPLICIT_COPIES` macro proposed in #24641 that tried to do this, but it didn't seem possible to generalize the implementation so we never added it.) It think it would be probably be reasonable to allow univalue to be explicitly but not implicitly copied, but I'm sure @theuni would have a better intuition.",
