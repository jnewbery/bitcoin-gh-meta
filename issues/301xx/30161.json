   "body" : "Extracted from #30126.\r\n\r\nThis adds a `VecDeque` data type, inspired by `std::deque`, but backed by a single allocated memory region used as a ring buffer instead of a linked list of arrays. This gives better memory locality and less allocation overhead, plus better guarantees (some C++ standard library implementations, though not libstdc++ and libc++, use a separate allocation per element in a deque).\r\n\r\nIt is intended for the candidate set search queue in #30126, but may be useful as a replacement for `std::deque` in other places too. It's not a full drop-in replacement, as I did not add iteration support which is unnecessary for the intended use case, but nothing prevents adding that if needed.\r\n\r\nEverything is tested through a simulation-based fuzz test that compares the behavior with normal `std::deque` equivalent operations, both for trivially-copyable/destructible types and others.\r\n",
