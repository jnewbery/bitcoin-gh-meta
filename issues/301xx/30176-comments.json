Even if we did add a monthly target (specified in days), then many months have different numbers of days in them, so this new handy setting will be wrong for many of them.\r\n\r\nThe best solution for you would seem to be to divide your monthly allowance by the number of days in the longest month (31) and set this as the `maxuploadtarget`. This way you will be on target in long months, and slighty under target in shorter months.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I'm misunderstanding something, otherwise I think we can close this out.",
