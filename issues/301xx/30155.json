   "body" : "This addresses the problem from #11600 that the Rolling Forward process after a crash (`ReplayBlocks()`) is uninterruptible. `ReplayBlocks` can take a long time to finish, and this can be especially annoying to GUI users who are taunted to \"press q to shutdown\" even though pressing \"q\" does nothing.\r\n\r\nNow, when an interrupt is received during `ReplayBlocks()`, the intermediate progress is saved:\r\nIn addition to writing the updated coins to disk, the flush adjusts the lower head block (saved in `DB_HEAD_BLOCKS`), so that with the next restart, the replay continues from where it was stopped without losing progress.\r\n\r\nI tested this manually on signet: A situation where `ReplayBlocks()` becomes necessary can be created by syncing with `-dbcrashratio=1` and stopping the node after ~70k blocks. Then, after the next restart, the replay process can be interrupted. I then used the `dumptxoutset` output to check that the final utxo-set hash is unaffected by how many times the process is interrupted.",
