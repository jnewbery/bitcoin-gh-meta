Update `doc/init.md` to mention generating an example bitcoin.conf instead of referencing the placeholder `share/examples/bitcoin.conf`. Update the code-formatted text with a markdown link.\r\n\r\n2. Also update `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` with a mention of the appropriate section of `contrib/devtools/README.md`.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n- Two years ago, `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` was replaced with [a placeholder file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b483084d866c16d97a34251ae652bac94f85f61d). To see an example `bitcoin.conf`, the user now runs the `contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh` script, which replaces the placeholder file with the parsed contents of `bitcoind --help`.\r\n\r\n- The instructions in `init.md` about an example `bitcoin.conf` haven't changed significantly since they were [added almost 10 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/234bfbf6a5fcba37e510e9cb6c1f2a629cd0290e/doc/init.md#L39). They should be updated to improve clarity.\r\n",
