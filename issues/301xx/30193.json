   "body" : "Draft PR for moving the ASAN + LSAN + USDT + friends job to github actions from Cirrus.\r\n\r\nI have disabled the other jobs while testing this to prevent them running unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR is that this task needs a full VM (or bare metal) to function, because of the tracepoints. It can not run in a container on an arbitrary Linux, because the outside machine must exactly match the specification of the distro used in the CI task config. This requires more maintenance for the persistent worker, and I think moving to GHA will reduce the maintenance burden, or at least make it possible for anyone to work on.\r\n\r\nAlso, it makes it easier to run the task on forks (bitcoin-inquisition, bitcoin-knots, devel forks, ...) without having to set-up a real machine.\r\n",
