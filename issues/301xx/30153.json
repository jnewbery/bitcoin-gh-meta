   "body" : "Update the `init.md` instructions about  generating an example `bitcoin.conf` file.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` placeholder file says to follow the instructions in `contrib/devtools/README.md`, which was confusing to me since that README talks about many scripts. It would be helpful to point out to the user which section to refer to.\r\n\r\nThis issue includes an accompanying PR #30154.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n- Two years ago, `share/examples/bitcoin.conf` was replaced with [a placeholder file](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/b483084d866c16d97a34251ae652bac94f85f61d). To see an example `bitcoin.conf`, the user now runs the `contrib/devtools/gen-bitcoin-conf.sh` script, which replaces the placeholder file with the parsed contents of `bitcoind --help`.\r\n\r\n- The instructions in `init.md` about an example `bitcoin.conf` haven't changed significantly since they were [added almost 10 years ago](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blame/234bfbf6a5fcba37e510e9cb6c1f2a629cd0290e/doc/init.md#L39).\r\n",
