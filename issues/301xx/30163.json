To reuse the existing blocks, I symlinked `~/snap/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin/blocks` to the mounted blocks directory and allowed snap to use external mounts with `snap connect bitcoin-core:removable-media`.\r\n\r\nbitcoin-core.qt starts, re-scans the blocks and then prunes my mounted blocks directory.\r\n\r\nIf bitcoin-core assumes pruning to be enabled by default, at least it should have asked for confirmation to delete blocks it did not download.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nbitcoin-core should track which blocks it actually downloaded and only prune those. Blocks that were provided externally should not be deleted or at least should require a user's confirmation.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n* have an external HDD containing full blockchain\r\n* install snap of latest bitcoin-core (here: v27.0.0)\r\n* allow snap using external HDD with `snap connect bitcoin-core:removable-media`\r\n* symlink  `~/snap/bitcoin-core/common/.bitcoin/blocks` to the mounted blocks directory\r\n* run bitcoin-core.qt\r\n* observe that blocks are pruned on external HDD\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### How did you obtain Bitcoin Core\n\nPackage manager\n\n### What version of Bitcoin Core are you using?\n\nv27.0.0\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 24.04 LTS\n\n### Machine specifications\n\n_No response_",
