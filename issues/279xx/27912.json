   "body" : "Fixes #27843\r\n\r\nTo avoid overflowing `-maxconnections` disconnect nodes marked for eviction directly inside of `AttemptToEvictConnection()`. This has the end result that new connections will only be accepted _after_ an existing connection is dropped, otherwise the new connection is dropped.\r\n\r\nPreviously the number of connected nodes could overflow `nMaxInbound` as (multiple) new connections could be accepted from `ThreadI2PAccept` -- each marking an existing connection to drop (in the future) -- before `ThreadSocketHandler` looped through to `DisconnectNodes()` and took care of the disconnections.\r\n\r\nNode disconnection and deletion are broken out into individual functions which handle a single node so they can be called both from `DisconnectNodes()` and `AttemptToEvictConnection`. This will result in more un/locking operations to perform mass disconnections, but as this only really happens when the network becomes inactive it should not be a problem.",
