   "body" : "The fee estimator currently considers the fee of a transaction in isolation (and doesn't consider transactions with unconfirmed parents). This could hold well when it was just a few outliers. But as CPFP is becoming common practice whether it is among wallets (#23074 has a few instances) or protocols (for instance the LN with anchor outputs), i'm afraid that if fees rise this can lead to significantly *underestimated* results.\r\nSee the first commit's message for details and #23074 for history.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a much simpler alternative to #23074. The point is to fix the issue before we come up with a reasonable way to track package feerates in the fee estimator.\r\n\r\nThe functional test is in a separate commit so reviewers can more easily cherry-pick it on master and see the fee estimator would return the wrong estimate.",
