      "body" : "@mzumsande, yes, this is what I meant - to avoid tx traffic over clearnet because it is privacy-sensitive, not because of the volume of the traffic. Obviously, this is only concerning to somebody who runs a wallet and emits their own transactions from that node.\r\n\r\nFor the 8-automatic outbound connections, I guess, in a setup like `-onlynet=onion -onlynet=ipv4=blocks`, when opening an automatic full connection we would have to open it only to onion peers. For inbound connections over ipv4 we would have to be shy and not send tx traffic to the peer, or maybe not send own transactions to the peer, relaying foreign transactions should be fine wrt privacy.\r\n\r\nActually `-addnode 1.2.3.4=blocks` does not interfere or contradict with `-onlynet=ipv4=blocks`. We can have both features if desired. That is - filter blocks/addr/tx traffic based on specific manually added node or for automatic connections, based on network type.",
