      "body" : "It looks like the `SQLiteBatch` being used to write data to disk is being destroyed unexpectedly, which causes subsequent writes using the same object(??) to have the wrong db transaction state that triggers this error.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm thinking that this might actually be due to a race condition? If there were two `SQLiteBatch` objects with one beginning a transaction, when the other executes its actions, and then destructs, it would detect that a transaction is in progress that it hadn't started, and thus do `ROLLBACK` which would result in the first batch object expecting a transaction when the other had aborted it.\r\n\r\nLooking at this further, I think the `ChainStateFlushed` that happens after we see `BEGIN TRANSACTION` is the culprit. The wallet makes a new batch for flushing the chainstate, and when this is destroyed, it also aborts the other batch's transaction.",
