That is still the case today.\r\n- 0.10.0, in which `-datacarrier` and `-datacarriersize` were first introduced, explicitly defined the term \"data carrier\" as pertaining to OP_RETURN transactions in the  [release notes](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.10.0.md#mining-and-relay-policy-enhancements) :\r\n```\r\n    -datacarrier=0/1 : Relay and mine \"data carrier\" (OP_RETURN) transactions if this is 1.\r\n    -datacarriersize=n : Maximum size, in bytes, we consider acceptable for \"data carrier\" outputs.\r\n```\r\n- PR #11058 added the doc \"A data carrying output is an unspendable output containing data. The script type is designated as TX_NULL_DATA.\"\r\n\r\nThe docs from #11058 have not changed except for moving files:\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/cb6d619931e8a29ad2bee034c94b9e7ff8ac0a65/src/kernel/mempool_options.h#L46-L53\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead of retroactively deciding that `-datacarriersize` applies to more than just `OP_RETURN`s, why not propose a new config option?",
