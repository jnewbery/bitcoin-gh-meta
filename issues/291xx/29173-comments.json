Otherwise, there would be a mismatch between the code and the documentation. I am not sure why it would be beneficial to re-introduce the mismatch.\r\n\r\nI have no objection to changing the code (along with the documentation). However, I think it would be better to change the documentation in the same pull request that also comes with the code changes. A pull request to change the code was opened *after* the documentation update, so it would make sense for that pull request to also update the documentation.",
