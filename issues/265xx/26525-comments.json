Even if we pulled 24.0, users could still just run 24.0rc4 which is functionally identical to 24.0 (the final release is just the last rc with the version number updated).\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that this option is default false.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIn regards to \"no technical reason\", I think the recent mempool situation perfectly illustrates why full RBF is useful. Users whose previously high feerate non-opt-in RBF transactions may have suddenly become low priority due to a sudden increase in transaction volume and subsequent rise in feerates. For such users, full RBF would allow them to bump their transactions to higher feerates in order to be confirmed in a timeframe closer to what they had expected with their original feerate.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIf I see continued brigading or trolling of this thread, it will be locked.

As such, this PR would only be included in 25.0+ or 24.1, which, as I understand it, defeats the purpose of removing the option. Users who want the option could just run 24.0. Even if we pulled 24.0, users could still just run 24.0rc4 which is functionally identical to 24.0 (the final release is just the last rc with the version number updated).\n\nI cannot let a false rigidity in the current process be an argument for a change that is potentially this disruptive and contrary to the Bitcoin we use today. This is a special circumstance in that it may affect an abnormally high quantity of transactions by opting them into a new behavior they did not choose.\n\nIt is also special in that the users it affects are not familiar with the process or how to interface with Bitcoin Core.\n\nIt took me roughly 40 hours of research and debate to fully understand the issues at play here, how to explain them, what my options are for helping, and then how to execute this work... An extremely high bar. \n\nMeanwhile the process ignored the controversy. \n\nThere are no rules set in stone for process and I hope Bitcoin Core can accommodate a need to be agile when appropriate.\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that this option is default false.\n\nWhy add it all then?\n\n> In regards to \"no technical reason\", I think the recent mempool situation perfectly illustrates why full RBF is useful. \n\nAs Sergej noted, even full RBF cannot guarantee inclusion in a congested mempool. When analyzed this is actually an extremely edge case (that could be addressed at the wallet level, allowing zero-conf to persist as an opt-in service) where you have only users that did not use an rbf wallet, did not include a sufficient fee, did not have a change output to cpfp, did not have a recipient willing to cpfp, and did not get dropped from the mempool yet.\n\n> If I see continued brigading or trolling of this thread, it will be locked. Consider yourselves warned.\n\nI would appreciate a little bit of patience here, I am not trying to attract trolls, I am trying to be heard and give non-Bitcoin-Core-dev users a chance to have a voice. This may result in some noise but I do not want my effort to help to be undermined by outsiders. \n",

I think there is no conceptual consensus among the Bitcoin Core project and wider community to deploy `mempoolfullrbf` option, neither there is consensus to remove it.\r\n\r\nMoving forward, I think the path should be to rebuild long-term conceptual consensus among all the community stakeholders on Core's policy design and release process to advance the situation either in the status quo of pre-#25600 or towards a coordinated fullrbf deployment. On the conceptual-side, I think the philosophy proposing a [policy regime](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021135.html) for each non-interfering Bitcoin use-case should be given more considerations, either to ground it or invalidate it. There is also a more open question, if Core should have a say at all in [policy settings](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021116.html) (some today are hardcoded and no one has ever asked to change them like `MAX_STANDARD_TX_WEIGHT`), or we should defer more and more flexibility towars the users in the future. Or even if conflicting transaction monitoring should be addressed by introducing a [new P2P protocol.](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021142.html)\r\n\r\nOn the procedural-side, I think one learning of the previous weeks of discussions is the necessity of encompassing the concerns of all the affected class of Bitcoin community stakeholders in the design of policy changes (merchants/second-layers operators/wallets/etc). I think not only by outreaching by default the known public communication channels and community process (e.g the Optech newsletter, the BOLT process, the LSP specification process, etc), but also by giving more leeway and time in each step of design and deployment. How much this \"policy design\" process should be formalized or tacit, I don't know. It's an open question to answer in the future.\r\n\r\nFrom my belief, before we have addressed those concerns and lessons of the past weeks, I don't think it's worthy to open\r\nmore `mempoolfullrbf` removal PRs. Addressing them in the coming future are none of my current Bitcoin Core engineering priorities, there are a lot of issues drawing my time in the Lightning space such as making LDK more secure or advancing in solving channel jamming. Glad if we see more contributors or users working on the issues of transaction-relay/mempool policy and anyone is free to steer the effort forward, in a respectful and patient fashion according to Bitcoin protocol development standards.",

First hearing about this controversy, my knee-jerk reaction was \"the mempool can't be trusted; that's why we need PoW at all\", but having given it further thought:\r\n> \r\n> 1. Yes, accepting unconfirmed transactions is, and always has been, risky. I wouldn't do it myself. But it's not my place, or the place of anyone else, to prevent, or even 'disincentivise', others making that choice. If they choose to accept an unconfirmed transaction and get double-spent, they're only hurting themselves.\r\n> 2. Users not knowing about RBF and ending up with a non-RBF TX stuck in the mempool for a long time is not a Bitcoin Core concern. It's a wallet concern. Wallets should flag RBF by default, or explicitly ask the user what they want per TX/on initialization.\r\n> 3. Users accepting unconfirmed transactions unwittingly aren't going to be prevented from doing so by full RBF. Again, wallet space.\r\n> \r\n> I've not really heard any other arguments, besides mempool-split brain and issues w/ CoinJoin & multiparty contracts, but it doesn't seem full-RBF actually fixes that.\r\n> \r\n> Besides that, no, an unreleased piece of code is not 'status quo'. It's true that replacement of non-RBF transactions is already possible, but making it far easier with full-RBF is objectively _not_ 'maintaining the status quo'.\r\n> \r\n> More than happy to hear other justifications for it. If there's an actual tehcnical benefit to full-RBF, then we should adopt it _by default_. But honestly this whole thing feels quite political.\r\n> \r\n> Edit: And to add, I think _making_ it a concern of Bitcoin core to 'disincentivise unsafe behaviour' is a huge mistake. It's taking on an additional responsibility you simply do not have at the moment, with potentially unlimited scope.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreat people like fools, you will attract foolishness.\r\nTreat people like responsible individuals, and you will get responsible behaviour and encourage learning.\r\n",

And yes, it is fully the naive merchant's responsibility to deal with the consequences of making bad security assumptions. However, what this PR suggests is to prevent casual users who are probably not attempting to maliciously double spend from performing a tx replacement. The security of accepting 0-conf transactions will not change with or without -mempoolfullrbf, it was insecure, and it will continue to be insecure.\r\n\r\nNo one is preventing merchants from continuing to accept this risk.\r\n\r\n> Users not knowing about RBF and ending up with a non-RBF TX stuck in the mempool for a long time is not a Bitcoin Core concern. It's a wallet concern. Wallets should flag RBF by default, or explicitly ask the user what they want per TX/on initialization.\r\n\r\nCorrect, mostly a UX concern.

Each node and all businesses already had the option to toggle with RBF depending on their needs and preferences.\n\nThe thing that making RBF default for all nodes does is it meddles with the fee market way too much at the cost of introducing this convenience, because accepting 0 conf transactions was a matter of individual user and merchant decisions and for each specific transaction, which in my opinion is a reasonable bet because chain reorgs are not that common and are probabilistic (no human can cheat their way into reorgs).\n\nTaking away this option from users and businesses forces them to not use Bitcoin L1 for simple daily high volume transactions and forces them to rely on LN; not necessarily a bad thing but disturbing the fee market to a huge extent is a heavy cost to consider. \n\nKey question is what is the need for switching from the current default? Convenience, at the cost of disturbing the fee market and spoiling the user experience of not being able to accept 0 conf transactions, unless explicitly opted into? \n\nIts already present as a feature for users and businesses that want it and the change has unneeded costs.",

I don't have much to add here, other than to say that I don't think the protocol development questions I raised on the mailing list and in #26438 have been addressed in an adequate way, and I think the next time someone proposes a change to an opt-in policy (whether that be eliminating opt-in RBF/opt-in non-replacement by default, or adding a new opt-in regime like the v3 proposal, or any other proposal where some transactions are processed under different policy rules than others) we should have a thoughtful discussion that addresses the points I've raised.",

      "body" : "ACK.\r\n\r\n**Main reason I've decided to actively ACK:**\r\n\r\n**It seems to me the concern about mempool split-brain is a legitimate concern, but full-RBF does not resolve that, and full-RBF via a default-off configuration flag will result in _more_ split-brain, putting those who aren't aware of this configuration flag, or what it means, at increased risk.**\r\n\r\nEdit to expand on the above following further discussion:\r\n\r\n1. Obviously those currently not waiting for confirmations are at increased risk; replacement of non-RBF flagging txs becomes far easier, and is invisible to users unaware of this config option until the replacement has been mined. It's worse even than accepting a zero-conf opt-in RBF transaction.\r\n2. Mempool split-brain is a DOS vector for multi-party contracts. Again, replacement becomes easier, and users without this config option can't see their collaborative tx has been replaced until the replacement is mined. If it happens again, that's another block wasted. So on.\r\n3. This implementation (default off config option) seems to damage the existing fee market/existing opt-in RBF; if we have people full-RBF replacing txs which were orignally not flagged as RBF (if they were originally flagged as RBF, full-RBF is providing _zero_ benefit), and people who haven't configured full-RBF (I'd wager most noderunners won't be aware of this config option) trying to use existing opt-in RBF competing for priority, all replacements will be visible to full-RBF users, but only the opt-in RBF replacements will be visible to users not configuring full-RBF... which, again, I _strongly_ suspect will be a significant majority of users. People _not_ changing this config value will have no way of knowing they are being outbid.\r\n\r\nOfc as usual, these are already _possible_, but it gets significantly worse the more people start full-RBFing (unless we have full-RBF by default), which this configuration flag will encourage. Even people following best-practices will be negatively impacted. It seems to me if we really want full-RBF, it should be the default policy, and adoption should have fair warning as these problems would still exist for older versions even with default full-RBF.\r\n\r\n**Original points:**\r\n\r\nThe only arguments against this I've seen are:\r\n1. **Unconfirmed transactions are unsafe to accept.**\r\n   The configuration flag doesn't improve anything on this front. 'I don't like the fact businesses are willing to accept the current risk profile' is not a good reason to encourage a change to mempool policy, even if you think they don't properly understand the risks. That's on them.\r\n    This argument lays the responsibility of preventing end-user bad practice with the Bitcoin Core team. This is not a current responsibility for the Bitcoin Core team, and has potentially unlimited scope. Taking on such responsibility should be actively avoided.\r\n5. **RBF is good.**\r\n    Yes, RBF is good. And we already have it. Conflating full-RBF with RBF as a whole is a misguided at best, disingenuous at worst argument.\r\n\r\n    2a. **People might accidentally/unknowingly broadcast a non-RBF transaction and get stuck in the mempool.**\r\n        This is just a variant of the 'RBF is good' argument.\r\n        This is a wallet-space issue. Wallets should, by default, enable RBF, or ask the user at TX or wallet initialization time. There is no reason for Bitcoin Core to address this issue further. Bitcoin Core already addresses the issue of stuck transactions: users can flag RBF on individual transactions. There is no trade-off, unless they are paying someone who accepts zero-conf, in which case, stuck transactions are not an issue.\r\n6. **Status quo (we already merged this config flag).**\r\n    The status quo is defined by what nodes are _actually running_ in production. An unreleased change is simply not the status quo.\r\n7. **User choice.**\r\n    This PR does not meaningfully remove user choice. Users can still choose to flag RBF on their transactions. Setting this config flag to 1 does not benefit a user unless others do so too, and even then, anybody setting this configuration value is aware enough and capable enough to flag RBF on their transactions. This is not a question of individual, self-sovereign choice. Users already have the individual, self-sovereign choice to flag RBF. This is a question of changing mempool policy, and forcing that choice on other users.\r\n    If we _really_ want to change mempool policy, we should do so. If there is technical value in full-RBF, we should adopt it. This configuration flag is a mechanism to adopt it without justifying its technical merits. The mempool is not part of the consensus layer, but mempool policy can have a significant impact on end-users whether they opt in or not. Changes to mempool policy should be made _very_ carefully, and at this point, I do not believe the change this PR reverts was made with an appropriate level of care.\r\n8. **People could adopt this change anyway/full-RBF is inevitable.**\r\n    OK, so why pre-emtively, needlessly support a configuration flag? The inclusion of this flag is an implicit suggestion users should use it. There are Core developers being very explicit and very vocal that users should use it. My question is why, and I've not received an answer I find satisfactory.\r\n\r\nMore than happy to change my mind if someone is willing to engage meaningfully. I already did so once.\r\n\r\nEdit: moved main reason for ACKing to top. Came to the realization while writing this, and think it's a more pressing issue than any debate around full-RBF in and of itself.",

What additional choice is this configuration option actually giving a user? What is the benefit of setting 1 for them? If they know enough to flag on full-RBF in their node's config, they know enough to flag RBF on their transactions.\r\n\r\nNot every user is going to be aware of RBF before they make their transaction. Not every user is using a wallet that is connected to a node that they control. This option, if enough nodes were to enable it (note it is false by default), would help such users in times of sudden feerate spikes such as the one that is happening now. Full RBF allows those users who did not have the foresight to opt-in to RBF, or are not using a wallet which gives them the option to. Many users simply do not change the default settings, and many wallets still default to not opt-in to RBF. As we have seen with the recent mempool situation, many users have found that transactions they previously thought were high priority are now being outbid, resulting in their transactions taking longer than expected. If enough nodes on the network have enabled `-mempoolfullrbf`, then those users could RBF their transaction, potentially by importing their keys into a wallet that allows them to do so. It's one of those things that users don't realize they need it until they do, but by that point, it's too late.",

It is merely the appearance of optionality, but expresses as an activation button or switch, where only ~15% of the network can vote to change the mode for the other 85%. \r\n\r\nIt is worth discussing the nuances because the nature of the feature is what is important, not whether it is off by default.\r\n\r\nFor example: if there were some other, even more controversial behavior that someone could propose they will always be able to say \"Well, it is OFF by default, if people don't want it, it will not happen!\" This method separates the process from the outcome, when they are clearly related. \r\n\r\nIf the argument for this feature is that it fixes something, the default OFF is inconsistent with that goal. If Bitcoin Core has a goal, then that amounts to steering policy. It would certainly start with an innocuous setting, grease it in with an OFF default, then turn the default ON in a future update. \r\n\r\nOverall this creates a staggered path to authority by engineers via separating the steps into parts that are allowable in isolation, even if they aren't justifiable on the whole.\r\n\r\n> This option is default false.

Almost everyone agree that RBF is better and it's more important not to get stuck in the mempool than enable zeroconf for in person, compulsory transactions.\r\n\r\nMy statement also includes wallets that have not implemented RBF, of which there are many. I have worded it that way because opt-in RBF requires specific nSquence values, and as nSequence values are required, all wallets have some default value for them. Many wallets default to nSequences that do not opt-in to RBF. Of course many of those wallets do not allow the user to opt in either.\r\n\r\nThe rest of your comment is incorrect as it incorrectly assumes that I am only speaking about wallets that have exposed opt-in RBF functionality to the user. But I am referring to all wallets which choose a default nSequence value that is not opt-in RBF.\r\n\r\n> Once you see important wallets that default to RBF but give an option for users to select \"RBF opt out\" then we could start having these arguments.\r\n\r\nLiterally this project. Bitcoin Core's wallet allows users to easily opt out of RBF, even though it is default on.",

I am arguing the same thing for the opposite choice, and my opponents prefer I do not have that choice. \n\nThe difference here is that in the current first-seen policy, both sides can have their preference. In a fullrbf environment, the zero-conf use case becomes overridden. \n\nZero-conf acceptance is responsibly implemented and used for many txns. This has been true for the entirety of Bitcoin's history. It seems odd to jeopardize the utility we currently enjoy just so a small minority of users can avoid having to think about which wallet to use.\n\n",

There is a common, broad understanding of which transactions will get relayed.

Users want to RBF to push their transactions through.\n\nSome use full-RBF. They broadcast replacements for transactions which weren't originally flagging RBF.\n\nThose who haven't enabled this flag don't see these replacements in their mempool. They flagged RBF originally, so they can replace their old transactions. But they are now (unknowingly) bidding against a class of users with more information than they have. They bump fees. Maybe, by chance, they bump higher than the full-RBF users. Maybe they don't. Either way, the full-RBF users see these fee bumps, and can outbid. Those who haven't enabled this configuration flag don't see the resulting full-RBF replacements, and don't even know they have been outbid.",

We don't care about people who use it, because they are using it wrong. There are some fraction of users who need to refresh txns, and don't know about RBF.\"\r\n\r\nâ¢â¢â¢ 0-confians with RBF: \"In PRACTICE we use 0-conf all the time, RBF is a great tool and option and both 0-conf and RBF work and are great for the respective benefits. The risk of 0-conf is manageable, as literally 1000s have managed it. No one said it was secure, but it DOES matter.\"\r\n\r\nIt genuinely feels to me like this is almost a spiteful change despite SO many merchants, processors, and lightning wallets taking advantage of 0-conf, and the simple fact that the overwhelming majority of nodes having \"first seen\" mempool policy DOES affect the difficulty of a re-broadcast of an unconfirmed transaction. It is very low assurance, but also most often specifically is associated with low risk transactions. \r\n\r\nI would bet money there are fewer 0-conf double spends than there are fraudulent & reversed credit card transactions by volume. The default \"first seen\" for network nodes is a very *soft* barrier, but it is a barrier nonetheless. The explanation from fullRBFers in here that \"you only need X miners\" and \"you can easily do X\" etc actually confirm this, that you have to go *around* the node network, which is actually a deterrent. To remove this such that all rebroadcasting is boosted by node policy, that it costs no time, & has its one small barrier removed, seems like a spiteful move that doesn't even have much of a benefit.\r\n\r\nHonestly, as someone who uses BTC/LN every single day, 0-conf channels have been one of the best things in 5 years for Lightning UX and onboarding. I have been a big fan of seeing many of my wallets also start taking advantage of RBF, and I've used it a great number of times. a \"first seen\" policy benefits both. A fullRBF default clearly hurts 0-conf, and is admitted as such by the people pushing it.\r\n\r\nI can't think of anything that needed fixing LESS than the current situation around 0-conf and RBF, and I don't get why this has suddenly become so important in the face of the huge number of people, services, and wallets that take advantage of it. And they won't go to something more secure, they will go to something *more convenient,* \r\nie. the difference will be made up with custodial BTC/LN\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nTLDR;\r\nâ¢ More people take advantage of 0-conf than need unstuck Txns\r\nâ¢ In THEORY 0-conf can't work --- in PRACTICE it works fine & even better than fiat alternatives\r\nâ¢ Both arguments rely on the acknowledgement that changing this node policy DOES negatively affect 0-conf\r\nâ¢ RBF and 0-conf have worked together just fine & both have manageable risk & trade offs in their differing uses\r\nâ¢ If 0-conf ever gets indefinitely & broadly attacked *without* help from the Core client purposefully weakening it, then it can die & we will bow to the superiority of the THEORY. Managing that risk is not hard. \r\nâ¢ There is very little trade off for maintaining \"first seen\"\r\nâ¢ There is potentially a pretty big trade off from weakening 0-conf by using the node network to *support* rather than *suppress* non-RBF rebroadcasts",

Why don't offer the option and let the market sort it out?\r\n\r\n> why this has suddenly become so important\r\n\r\nMaybe, just maybe, because there are many people who think is important? Have you ever considered this? Perhaps you have totally missed the point?\r\n\r\nYour TL;DR also doesn't make sense to me.\r\n\r\nWhat really boils down to is:\r\nYou and others keep saying \"unconfirmed transactions are fine\", and I don't give a damn, accept what you want.\r\nBut then they are at the same time so fragile and they need so much artificial barriers to work, that apparently you have to prevent even a relatively small part of node operators from choosing for themselves their own policies.\r\n\r\nLeave us alone, manage your risks without putting artificial barriers on other people nodes.\r\n",

Why should we decide for them.\r\n\r\nHow would a merchant benefit from full-RBF?\r\nI can only think of one way, Instructing a customer to import it's seed in a new wallet that supports easy doublespending.

If there's enough demand for thiefs to collude with miners to steal from merchant (or unstuck their transactions) then they'll figure out how to collect payment and do a profit share aside the mempool.\r\n\r\nThe miners that want to sabotage the first seen policy for extra profit already have the option to run from a fork. There are almost no arguments to make it easier or ethical for them on this branch.\r\n\r\nThe fullRBF PR came about as a way to fix a rare pinning attack, that it may not actually fix then merged with very low regard of current real world usage of zeroconf.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to reconsider adding the fullRBF option until either there are more reported cases of non RBF being replaced by miners out of band or that the majority of wallets have implemented RBF and users actually disable RBF for zeroconf reasons.",

If the user is onchain they could pay, or be paid, instantly offchain. \n\nThis type of creativity and optionality is a huge boon to apps and users because LN is actually quite complicated to convey and provide in a self-custodial way. \n\nThe trend right now is for LN users to use custodial, censorable, trusted accounts. This is not necessary or healthy for Bitcoin at all. \n\nI am fighting so hard to remove this feature and cease the full RBF movement because I am deeply aware of, and sensitive to, user and builder needs. I want Bitcoin to remain useful for commerce, and that means letting us continue to have the ability to opt-in to perfectly risk-manageable zero-conf acceptance. \n\nI will not concede my awareness of 13 years of Bitcoin history and proof of utility for full-RBF propents' speculation about the future. \n\nUsers have all the choices at the wallet level, but full RBF mempools would reduce those choices on the whole. \n\nThis week, I will be working with Bitrefill to provide actual statistics of the quantity of users affected and volume of Bitcoin commerce currently benefiting from responsible management of zero-conf risk  exposure to provide instant acceptance as service. \n\nZero-conf is thriving and benefiting Bitcoiners across the world. The Full RBF mempool feature is detrimental, disruptive, and fails to solve any of the issues its proponents hope to address.",

This logic is extremely weak and could be applied to basically any distinctive aspect of a txn, like using native segwit, various op_returns, etc.\r\n\r\nAny distinctive transaction characteristic is almost certainly being used by chain analysis right now, including RBF flagging. But RBF flagging is different in that there is no technical reason it's needed for being able to replace a transaction, only a \"social\" one, and I believe (and will configure my own node accordingly) that it's time to do away with it.\r\n\r\n> Further, this new feature does not actually eradicate or hide the behavior of wallets that do facilitate RBF flagging\r\n\r\nYou don't need to change the behavior of existing wallets. Once full-RBF becomes reliable, it's enough that just one wallet starts flagging transactions as opt-in RBF at random, and that will create reasonable doubt for everyone else.\r\n\r\n> However, you can probably never expect to be able to hide your distinction if actually replacing txns.\r\n\r\nThe distinction is only revealed for transactions that actually end up being replaced. If I want all my transactions to be replaceable but only end up replacing a small number of them, for the majority of them full-RBF would allow me to hide the fact that they were meant to be replaceable. This is similar to how Taproot improves privacy even when you sometimes need to reveal that a script tree exists.\r\n\r\n> I want what I want because I want it\r\n\r\nIf my phrasing didn't make it clear, I would support the inclusion of a default-false local policy option even if I didn't personally like it (e.g. something like -notaproot), regardless of anyone's reasons for wanting it.",

From a network perspective (and perhaps even an individual node perspective) I don't think it is optimal that the zero conf nodes ban the full RBF nodes or vice versa. The P2P/policy/mempool devs will have a more informed perspective but I would have thought this doesn't achieve much apart from fragmenting the network into segments. A zero conf node has to eventually verify a valid RBF spend if it is mined in a block even if it initially refuses to allow it into its mempool and refuses to peer with full RBF nodes. It doesn't seem optimal that it refuses to verify that transaction until the last possible moment i.e. it is forced to verify it because it has been mined.\r\n\r\nSo free to ban, certainly.

Some risk/convenience tradeoff is going to want to operate on 'good faith' at lower confirmation counts (or *no* confirmation counts, as we see).

From a network perspective (and perhaps even an individual node perspective) I don't think it is optimal that the zero conf nodes ban the full RBF nodes or vice versa. The P2P/policy/mempool devs will have a more informed perspective but I would have thought this doesn't achieve much apart from fragmenting the network into segments. A zero conf node has to eventually verify a valid RBF spend if it is mined in a block even if it initially refuses to allow it into its mempool and refuses to peer with full RBF nodes. It doesn't seem optimal that it refuses to verify that transaction until the last possible moment i.e. it is forced to verify it because it has been mined.\r\n> \r\n> So free to ban, certainly. But I don't think it achieves much if anything.\r\n\r\n@michaelfolkson Nobody has information about the impact if most of the nodes ban based on service flag.\r\n\r\nIt was sarcasm and I do not care because he won't ban or if he does won't affect anything:\r\n\r\nContext: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25600\r\n\r\nBAN nodes signalling full rbf with bitcoin knots or https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25600\r\n\r\nBitcoin is beyond this and there will be nodes using full rbf without signalling\r\n\r\nFYI: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25600 was not merged in core ",

The point is that the nature of \"what are the characteristics of an unconfirmed transaction\" is open to shift with 24.0... as is the nature of \"what does non-rbf mean if accepting nodes have a convenient toggle to change that definition under load.\"  \r\n\r\nI've run luke-jr forks before, and I'll likely do so again, but I disagree with him here. Implementation wise, this was controversial to begin with, the original DoS legs are shorter than we thought... the real-world use cases are more nuanced and present than we thought... and the original change was against the status quo, adds code-branching (maintenance) complexity, adds complexity to mempool logic under load, degrades consensus by creating two classes of (core) nodes at high mempool states... for what good?\r\n\r\nI dunno. I feel like \"pre consensus\" <del>rules</del> guidelines are worth fighting a bit harder here than just saying \"whelp, the tech debt we recently merged that requires us to shift conversation targets (from users to node operators), has unknown risk factors and unclear (any?) network benefits, and blew up some business practices that we didn't like the risk factors for is _already in_, so let's keep going!\"\r\n\r\n",

That means the users of those wallets will effectively have their assets frozen while making a transaction, if the mempool suddenly balloons overnight and they are unaware of that.\r\n\r\nFull RBF will do away with all that and allow you to import your privkeys into an RBF-supporting wallet and fix the TX manually.\r\n\r\nPeople here are talking about how bad this is going to be for the businesses, but imagine the scenario of users making a payment to a gateway during a congested mempool, without RBF wallets, and then the tx confirms far too late when the payment has already expired. They have even less recourse than the businesses to make up for the lost money.",

These stats show actual utilization of zeroconf to benefit Bitcoiners, at scale. These stats show what utility may be lost if the mempools convert to opting standard txns into RBF policy without their request. We only care about this because Bitcoin users care about this and we want to see Bitcoin used for commerce more, not less.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are from September 2022, a typical month for us. The unit is in payments, broken down into those that got zeroconf processed and those which didn't, and why they didn't: \r\n\r\nTotal on chain:\t46297\t\r\nZeroconf:\t31983\t(68%)\r\nNot zeroconf:\t14314\t(31%)\r\n\t\t\r\nNot zeroconf reasons:\t\t\r\nRBF\t8345\t(18%)\r\nToo low fee rate\t3014\t(6%)\r\nToo many unconfirmed ancestors\t531\t(1%)\r\nNot eligble for zeroconf due to high value\t2424\t(5%)\r\n\r\nTransactions cancelled (double-spent) by user\t104\t\r\nOf which received product\t0\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure if this data changes anything, this is just for our company, there are many competitors, merchant services and individual btcpayserver operators operating in similar ways to us, accepting a certain amount of risk on lower-value transactions in order to benefit users and provide a more clear user experience. How many that is is hard know for sure but it's safe to say it's a multiple of the above, all of which will be impacted in unpredictable ways if this new policy becomes used on bitcoin.",

Once people have been burned by waiting a few hours or days will they not change wallet?\r\n\r\nThe wallets maybe, but the exchange is harder to change for some people because they might not support the same deposit/withdraw methods, and dubious geo-restrictions and KYC processes will limit the number of alternatives a user has anyway. I do not know which exchanges do RBF internally if any even do so at all. And the above only applies to bitcoiners like you and me; newbies will just give up on bitcoin instead of switching wallets (or using Lightning).\r\n\r\n> Aside that the mempool has been near empty for 3 years, are you aware that both the sender and recipient can increase the effective fee via CPFP? All wallet that support spending entire balance can do CPFP.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that does not work if the parent tx already spends the entire balance (or as much balance so that the remainder is not a sufficient tx fee). So that helps in some circumstances but not in all of hem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's the big picture:\r\n\r\nPeople who get started on Bitcoin will only give us one chance to make it (bitcoin) work properly. Any kind of UX issue will in most cases cause us to lose that user forever, they are usually not going to come to a forum for technical support. The Bitcoin protocol is slow to change over several years, so people will think they are dealing with the same software more or less. Which means even if the underlying issue gets fixed, psychological state of mind will prevent former users from coming back.\r\n\r\nFull RBF is by no means a pancrea. It does not solve all problems of Bitcoin or even transactions. But it is a step in the right direction. Direction is something charted by the Bitcoin _community_, not by Bitcoin Core developers alone. Community includes users, merchants, developers, regulators, companies, influencers etc etc who are interacting with Bitcoin in some way.\r\n\r\nNow most people will never vote on policy issues, so what happens is that a minority of people end of voting instead. 100-200 or so people weighing in on this Github issue and the mailing list thread and forum threads is all we got, and though its a far cry from millions of Bitcoin users, it is what it is.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon that OP and some other people are calling gaslighting is just a consequence of having a minority of people discussing this issue. That a large portion of the accused are Bitcoin Core developers is simply because we are on official Bitcoin Core channels.\r\n\r\nSegwit and the block size wars was just one example of the community getting split and then reaching a consensus that resolves the issue in a way that is good for everyone. And eventually, this is what will happen here as well. Possibly in the years after Full RBF is deployed en-masse in a future Bitcoin Core version.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

These stats show actual utilization of zeroconf to benefit Bitcoiners, at scale. These stats show what utility may be lost if the mempools convert to opting standard txns into RBF policy without their request. We only care about this because Bitcoin users care about this and we want to see Bitcoin used for commerce more, not less.\r\n\r\nIf you really think this is a good idea, it would help to open-source the intelligent double-spending tools in question. Because right now, maybe you and a few other vendors know how to do this properly, but this info is not public. There is not even an internet tutorial on how to write code for correctly classifying zeroconf transactions.",

The process failed. Normal rules were not followed. A controversial change was rushed in with only the Bitcoin Core developer userbase being aware. The community is now more aware and it is quite clear this is controversial and impacts a lot of people. The mempool status quo is at risk of a negative change. A change I have argued will negatively impact users, merchants, miners, and overall Bitcoin utility.\r\n\r\nNow Bitcoin Core has to demonstrate that it can responsibly handle this kind of situation. If Core lets this change stand, it is a message to users that these devs are an authority, and if users ever want to conflict with Bitcoin Core agendas, they will need to be ready to fork the code or undertake a massive campaign, beyond what I had to do here. Does Bitcoin Core care about the trust of users and merchants? I hope so. If not, who is Bitcoin for exactly?\r\n\r\nSome people may indeed stick to v24 and run that, but I am skeptical. People run latest versions, and the fullrbf movement could die on the vine if removed immediately. As it should. ",

I think you must be (once again) imagining that mempool policy is a part of consensus and that you can conjure a network where nodes won't relay any RBF (with certain rules to prevent DOS).\r\n\r\n> Also, claiming you would \"never run such a thing\" is hyperbolic, considering you probably ran a FSS mempool in your node for most of your Bitcoin history.\r\n\r\nWe are all learning, the Bitcoin rabbit hole is deep and wide. Until recently I used opt-in RBF on ~all of my transactions and was simply annoyed when services such as yours treated them differently (although I haven't personally used yours, I have used other similar services). With the recent discussion of offering the option to change mempool rules such that all transactions would be treated the same again, it is clear to me that this is the correct way to move bitcoin forward. Accepting unconfirmed transactions for payment (or even to lock in an exchange rate) has always been risky, and this _may_ effect the risks involved. Nobody has been able to show that it _actually_ effects the risks.",

Some of these pre-consensus rules are clear and simple (valid signatures, inputs and outputs, etc)... and others of these are (apparently?) more controversial (didn't include a minimum fee, etc). \r\n\r\nSince the 'mempool' is a kind of shared experience, it's ideal for the network if we can agree on what is desirable there and when someone is 'peeing in the pool' so to speak. What full RBF breaks in my mind is the arbitrary and capricious changing of the meaning from the first-seen non-RBF transaction to **suddenly become** RBF.\r\n\r\nFirst-Seen-Safe  but allowed RBF feels like a rational move. full-rbf is irrational. If the user wanted rbf, they mark it. Not respecting that as a mempool is... pardon the pun, kinda ð©ing in the pool. \r\n\r\nI completely understand that confirmation counts in the blockchain *is* the consensus mechanism, by definition... but we are spending time and thought discussing a very valid pre-consensus scenario of under what conditions transactions should be allowed to 'cut in line' (yes, theoretically against oneself)... and I'm unwilling to sacrifice the (clearly used) functionality of first-seen because we want to allow line-cutting **and** mind-changing for larger fees. \r\n\r\nI'm OK with line-cutting ( fss-rbf ) for larger fees... but not changing minds (_edit for clarity_ **when** the user initially stated they would **not** be changing their mind). If the user broadcasts a transaction with the stated intention of not changing outputs, treat it as such.  I believe it's still worth striving for closer alignment on what constitutes a valid pre-consensus mempool-worthy transaction. Remove -mempoolfullrbf imo",

If you do not, then you also do not care about RBF flags or fullrbf. If you do, then my ideas make just as much sense as RBF or fullrbf. Whether these things are consensus only affects interoperability, not whether the designs affect outcomes.\r\n\r\n> We are all learning, the Bitcoin rabbit hole is deep and wide. Until recently I used opt-in RBF on ~all of my transactions and was simply annoyed when services such as yours treated them differently (although I haven't personally used yours, I have used other similar services). With the recent discussion of offering the option to change mempool rules such that all transactions would be treated the same again, it is clear to me that this is the correct way to move bitcoin forward. Accepting unconfirmed transactions for payment (or even to lock in an exchange rate) has always been risky, and this _may_ effect the risks involved. Nobody has been able to show that it _actally_ effects the risks.\r\n\r\nEveryone always treated RBF txns the same. Merchants make them wait 1+ confs. fullrbf means they will be forced to do that for nonRBF txns too, instead of offering 0conf as a service. This is strictly worse for you as a Bitcoin shopper.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, mempoolfullrbf means no option for fast buying at merchants. Opt-in FSS ideas mean that you could get faster treatment when supported. You have nothing to lose, only to gain, as a consumer.",

There are dynamics here somewhat analogous to soft vs. hard forks of the consensus code. If there is a _more_ permissive policy run by some nodes (threshold ~1%? 5%? depending on preferential peering) then that policy overrides a less permissive default policy. If there is a less permissive policy run by some nodes, it has no impact on the more permissive default policy. Game theory here says that once a more permissive policy gains even a small foothold in the network, the only rational move is to change the default. You are trying to fight this game theory by making it _harder_ for people to run the more permissive policy, but the cat is already out of the bag. There is a preferential peering network, Knots, and many node runners like myself who continue to make the default less and less relevant.\r\n\r\n> Everyone always treated RBF txns the same.

You are _assuming_ that fraud rates on unconfirmed will be enough higher to break the business model. You do not have evidence of this. Do you think fullrbf unconfirmed payments will have as high of a chargeback rate as legacy credit card payments? I don't. One big reason for chargeback is buyer's remorse which doesn't really impact the safety of unconfirmed acceptance. The measures that businesses already have in place to detect replacement transactions and screen customers before accepting FSS unconfirmed transactions will also work on fullrbf unconfirmed transactions. They already are.",

But we can easily determine a lower bound based on the number of nodes that advertise the FULL_RBF service bit: based on my DNS seed records there are currently 40 IPv4 nodes advertising the FULL_RBF service bit, out of ~5400 reachable IPv4 nodes in total, making 0.74% the lower bound. For IPv6 nodes my DNS seed records show 12 nodes advertising the FULL_RBF service bit, out of ~1100 reachable nodes in total, making 1.1% the lower bound.\r\n\r\nAs I [explained on the bitcoin-dev mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-December/021251.html) it'll take ~400 IPv4 nodes, with well-distributed IP prefixes, for there to be a 50% chance of a IPv4 node having a full-rbf peer in their 8 outgoing connections.\r\n\r\nNote: Bitcoin Core does _not_ advertise the FULL_RBF service bit. Only my full-rbf peering fork and Bitcoin Knots do. So these numbers only represent the minority who have chosen not to run Bitcoin Core, and have chosen to enable mempoolfullrbf. Based on social media posts, the super majority of people running mempoolfullrbf are doing so via Bitcoin Core.",

We can make the public aware of the dangers of these projects (in true bitcoin spirit) without attacking them with changes in core; Please correct me if I'm wrong about this being an attack on these projects by sharing some benefits that I as a node operator gain from this.\r\n\r\nBy making it more dangerous so as to disincentivize projects from using it does not really constitute an improvement in security. People will still accept zero-conf, and now the chances of them getting rekt is higher. Protecting users from zero conf can only be achieved through more education on the dangers of zero conf.",

Quite a few services are using this flag too, eg BTCPay now activates full-rbf by default: https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker/pull/736 Both Umbrel and Start9 Labs, among others, have added support for this flag to their node offerings.\n\nAlso full-RBF replacements are getting mined quite frequently now due to mempools being full and transactions getting evicted/expired. ð\n\nRe: usage of full-RBF, as you know for multiparty transactions, the mere existence of full-rbf miners and nodes is sufficient to mitigate low fee double spend attacks: https://petertodd.org/2023/fullrbf-multiparty-protocols These protocols do not need to implement any specific code beyond having full-rbf available. Meanwhile, with mempools being constantly full the consequences of low fee double spends are much worse than usual, with low fee transactions taking days or even longer to get mined. On balance, reliable multi-party Lightning channels and especially coinjoin are certainly more valuable to Bitcoin than the tiny handful of people still trying to make zeroconf a thing.\n\nThis pull-req should be closed. With mempools being constantly full it's quite ridiculous to claim that zeroconf still has value. Indeed, the value of on-chain transactions for person to person/merchant transactions has diminished significantly from a few months ago due to high costs. At this moment mempool.info estimates a $0.60 fee for a standard transaction at low priority; I'm certainly not inclined to spend $0.60 in fees for an on-chain transaction to pay a $15 phone top-up on Bitrefill. A lightning transaction will cost pennies or less, and it'll be instant.\n\nOn March 16, 2023 9:58:16 PM GMT+01:00, John Carvalho ***@***.***> wrote:\n>Just reviving this. Four months have passed.

What are the current stats on people flagging mempoolfullrbf=1?\r\n> \r\n> My guess is that literally only the hostile devs in this thread run it, and whichever miners they managed to persuade personally, and that there is no significant signal of support or usage of the feature in the wild, or am I wrong?\r\n> \r\n> It would be nice for the remaining thousands of users and merchants to not have to look over our shoulder and wonder if Core will sneak it on by default in the future, so can we just merge this PR and call this a lesson learned?\r\n> \r\n> Can we treat this as a failed forced activation? Thanks.\r\n\r\nOn the conceptual discussion, I would say we're still on the same stage than we were four months ago:\r\n- I think 0conf transaction acceptance is still exploitable from using advanced non-RBF tricks like mempool-partitioning [0].\r\n- I believe the design philosophy to each use-case its policy regime has not been argued further [1], even if I pointed out it might exposed use-cases to exploitable fee asymmetries [2].\r\n- I think the idea of a new p2p extension to monitor conflict has not been really explored further [3].\r\n- I think the conciliation of the 0confs use-case with new policy regime like nversion=3 has not been very discussed (e.g I believe 0conf software might have to upgrade themselves to reject future nversion=v3 transactions).\r\n\r\nI still hold the belief that replacement by default is long-term the best solution for the Bitcoin ecosystem to satisfy contracting protocols and multi-party applications (coinjoin, lightning channels, dual-funding, splicing) requirements. Though, I still think we should build consensus on the above questions (whatever the direction outcome) before Bitcoin Core removing mempoolfullrbf option or activating by default.\r\n\r\nIndependenttly of the final outcome on mempoolfullrbf, I still think we should improve Bitcoin Core communication standards\r\nin term of mempool policy rules changes (at least when it changes a years-long default) and maybe commit them in `bitcoin/doc/policy`\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/jamesob/mempool.work#attack-mempool-partitioning\r\n[1] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-October/021135.html\r\n[2] https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26438#issuecomment-1299522242\r\n[3] https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021142.html",

Running a non-default mempool makes it easier to put different txs in your mempool compared to the majority of the network, which:\r\n\r\n - makes it easier to fingerprint your node and its network peers\r\n - creates pinning vectors\r\n - can allow your counterparties to hide unconfirmed payments to you or hide double-spends of payments to you\r\n - lowers the effectiveness of compact block relay\r\n\r\nA node operator may well decide that they aren't concerned about any of those drawbacks, or that the benefits outweigh the harm/risks, of course, but it's not true that there is no harm.\r\n\r\nLooking through [fullrbf.mempool.observer](https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/)'s data, the first page currently has 23 \"replaced\" txs mined, compared to 3 replacement txs (one of which was itself replaced). Of the three \"replacements\" that were mined, two of them replaced txs that were only in the fork.observer mempool for 2 or 3 seconds, and never made it to my mempool. The other tx (0ac289b3058bc6a09e071e91496361b2562e792fe878802142ce81c3a60386af) replaced its predecessor 18 minutes after the predecessor was first broadcast upping the feerate from 4.58sat/vb to 24.05sat/vb, but only improved its confirmation time by ~10 minutes. The vast majority of \"fullrbf\" txs on pages 1-9 that have been mined are ones that were replaced after expiring from the default mempool, so did not take advantage of the fullrbf logic at all. Of the remainder, almost all seem to be opentimestamps transactions mined by Luxor.\r\n\r\nThere's also been a lot of stale blocks recently, with [fork.observer](https://fork.observer/) reporting two in the last couple of days (780979 and 780994) and nine in total over the last 5 months (since October when this was available in rcs). That's a lot compared to the previous 5 months in which there were zero stale blocks (21 May to 21 Oct), but it may just be seasonal, as the 7 months prior to that had 12 stale blocks (21 Oct 2021 to 20 May 2022).",

Running a non-default mempool makes it easier to put different txs in your mempool compared to the majority of the network, which:\r\n> \r\n>     * makes it easier to fingerprint your node and its network peers\r\n\r\nHow specifically does turning *on* full-rbf enable that attack?\r\n\r\n>     * creates pinning vectors\r\n\r\nCan you explain what exactly you mean by this in the context of full-rbf?\r\n\r\n>     * can allow your counterparties to hide unconfirmed payments to you\r\n\r\nWhy is the deliberate hiding of *unconfirmed* payments to you even a problem?\r\n\r\n> or hide double-spends of payments to you\r\n\r\nHow does turning *on* full-rbf make it easier to hide double-spends of payments to you? Note that BTCPay now turns full-rbf on by default in their docker image, specifically because it makes it marginally more likely for you to notice a double-spend.\r\n\r\n>     * lowers the effectiveness of compact block relay\r\n\r\nYou seem to be arguing two contradictory things: full-rbf isn't used, and yet it also materially lowers the effectiveness of compact block relay.\r\n\r\n> A node operator may well decide that they aren't concerned about any of those drawbacks, or that the benefits outweigh the harm/risks, of course, but it's not true that there is no harm.\r\n> \r\n> Looking through [fullrbf.mempool.observer](https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/)'s data, the first page currently has 23 \"replaced\" txs mined, compared to 3 replacement txs (one of which was itself replaced). Of the three \"replacements\" that were mined, two of them replaced txs that were only in the fork.observer mempool for 2 or 3 seconds, and never made it to my mempool. The other tx (0ac289b3058bc6a09e071e91496361b2562e792fe878802142ce81c3a60386af) replaced its predecessor 18 minutes after the predecessor was first broadcast upping the feerate from 4.58sat/vb to 24.05sat/vb, but only improved its confirmation time by ~10 minutes.\r\n\r\nNote that  [fullrbf.mempool.observer](https://fullrbf.mempool.observer/) has not been working for at least the past two weeks.\r\n\r\n> The vast majority of \"fullrbf\" txs on pages 1-9 that have been mined are ones that were replaced after expiring from the default mempool, so did not take advantage of the fullrbf logic at all. Of the remainder, almost all seem to be opentimestamps transactions mined by Luxor.\r\n\r\nCan you give examples of these transactions that you claim were expired? By expiring, to be clear, you mean expiring due to the expiration time being reached? Because that would be a transaction previously broadcast two weeks prior, and I'm not aware of any such examples.\r\n \r\n> There's also been a lot of stale blocks recently, with [fork.observer](https://fork.observer/) reporting two in the last couple of days (780979 and 780994) and nine in total over the last 5 months (since October when this was available in rcs). That's a lot compared to the previous 5 months in which there were zero stale blocks (21 May to 21 Oct), but it may just be seasonal, as the 7 months prior to that had 12 stale blocks (21 Oct 2021 to 20 May 2022).\r\n\r\n@1440000bytes's [plot of stale blocks](https://twitter.com/1440000bytes/status/1637323742291320832/photo/1) doesn't show any clear link to anything.\r\n\r\nAnyway the data from [miningpool.observer/template-and-block](https://miningpool.observer/template-and-block) shows that blocks routinely include a dozen or so unexpected transactions. It's not clear if those are transactions not in miningpool.observer's mempoo, and thus relevant to compact blocksl; @0xB10C, can you clarify this point?",

Essentially all\nmempool policy changes can be used to double spend unconfirmed transactions,\neven the dynamic min-relay-fee. It's extremely easy.\n\nYou create two conflicting transactions, tx1 and tx2, such that tx1 is accepted\nby some % of miners and nodes but not your target, and tx2 is accepted by your\ntarget. You broadcast tx1 first, and then broadcast tx2. You win if tx1 happens\nto be mined first.\n\nEven the dynamic min-relay-feerate can be exploited in this fashion. Broadcast\ntx1 with a very low fee, such that most nodes do not accept it. Your target is\nunlikely to know tx1 existed. Next broadcast tx2. Finally use CPFP to bump the\nfee of tx1 sufficiently that tx1 is preferable to mine over tx2. You can also\nuse full-rbf to double-spend tx1 with a higher fee than tx2: plenty of hashing\npower is running full-rbf, and you can also take advantage of increases in the\nlimit kicking tx1 out.\n\nI've heard claims that many miners are using unusually large mempools, which\nwould make this attack particularly feasible. Of course, the precise dynamic\nmin-relay-fee varies from node to node, so simply picking a feerate close to\nthe limit of most nodes would work well too.\n\n> > Obviously, mempoolfullrbf is getting a lot of usage.

This is not true anymore with dual-funding or splicing, where inputs can be contributed by 2 or more Lightning nodes. And iirc the BOLT spec, you can combine dual-funding with `option_zeroconf`. This type of deployement can be advantageous from a user safety viewpoint as you don't have to trust the LSP with your pre-paid payment in exchange of an instant inbound channel.

Note, I think turning mempoolfullrbf=1 increases the change to learn about an economic double-spend (e.g a LN node double-spending a dual-funding because the liquidity market conditions have changed), however a protocol relaying all the conflicts would be even better as you might have multiple counterparties in a collaborative transaction, and you might want to know all who have done so for application-specific reputation system.\r\n\r\n> The constant attempts to shoehorn random stuff into nostr is hilarious. nostr\r\n> is a highly centralized system revolving around a handful of nodes; nostr has\r\n> no mechanism to decentralize note distribution.

If such delivery mechanism takes the form of e.g LN onion routing you might have even more privacy-preserving transaction broadcast than current mechanism. The payment ensures a native DoS prevention mechanism, an issue we had with more privacy-preserving transaction broadcast on the base-layer like dandelion.\r\n\r\nFrom a second-layer perspective, redundancy and privacy of transaction broadcast matters as much as decentralization of the transaction-relay network itself.",

For e.g, if we allow segwit v3 spends (a policy loosening), where the size of spends is smaller than other spends, the satoshi cost (whatever the sat/vb) of committing a double-spend is lower. This what I meant by saying \"not all the mempool policies change are equal in term of practicality of exploitation\".\n\nFor any practical use of on-chain Bitcoin the cost of fees has to be a small % of the economic value of the transaction. Thus only in really pathological cases will differences in feerates for double spend transactions be relevant.\n\n>> All uses of 0conf LN channels that I'm aware of in the wild are not relying on\n>> unconfirmed transactions being secure.

This is not true anymore with dual-funding or splicing, where inputs can be contributed by 2 or more Lightning nodes. And iirc the BOLT spec, you can combine dual-funding with `option_zeroconf`. This type of deployement can be advantageous from a user safety viewpoint as you don't have to trust the LSP with your pre-paid payment in exchange of an instant inbound channel. Now, of course you have mempool issues, so it sounds more a trade-off in term of security model?\n\nAs I said, \"all uses of 0conf LN channels _in the wild_\"\n\nDo you have an example of a _deployed_ service that is actually vulnerable to this? Or are you only discussing hypothetical services that could be deployed in the future?\n\n>I still think the conceptual points raised in my above post would be better to be addressed before to turn mempoolfullrbf=1 by default. Note, I think turning mempoolfullrbf=1 increases the change to learn about an economic double-spend (e.g a LN node double-spending a dual-funding because the liquidity market conditions have changed), however a protocol relaying all the conflicts would be even better as you might have multiple counterparties in a collaborative transaction, and you might want to know all who have done so for application-specific reputation system.\n\nWhat you are proposing is the creation of _new_ 0conf infrastructure for _new_ applications. Let's be clear: are you proposing that we encourage _more_ services to adopt 0conf reliance?\n\nGiven that a significant % of hashing power is mining full-rbf right now, and the many unavoidable exploits I've mentioned, this is reckless.\n\n>> The constant attempts to shoehorn random stuff into nostr is hilarious. nostr\n>> is a highly centralized system revolving around a handful of nodes; nostr has\n>> no mechanism to decentralize note distribution.

If you want to discuss future hypothetical proposals, you should not confuse them by using the name of existing services with concrete architectures.\n\n>On the contrary, I think Nostr offers very different decentralization trade-off than base-layer transaction-relay network, where end-users can pay to have their notes reliably delivered to subscribing clients.\n\nNostr is trust based by virtue of having no built in mechanism for clients to learn that a relay is censoring them. Nostr could have implemented a blockchain. But did not. A future service could of course fix this; it may or may not be called nostr.\n\n> If such delivery mechanism takes the form of e.g LN onion routing you might have even more privacy-preserving transaction broadcast than current mechanism. The payment ensures a native DoS prevention mechanism, an issue we had with more privacy-preserving transaction broadcast on the base-layer like dandelion.\n\nWhat you are talking about has no relevance to double spend _detection_. That requires a broad effort to learn about all possible transactions. Not a specific one that the initiator wants you to know about.\n\n>From a second-layer perspective, redundancy and privacy of transaction broadcast matters as much as decentralization of the transaction-relay network itself.\n\nAgain, you are getting off topic here. That discussion has nothing to do with mempoolfullrbf.\n",
