   "body" : "Reverts #25353.\r\n\r\nI am submitting this PR after many discussions with users, merchants, and Bitcoin Core developers. \r\n\r\nThey agree that the nuances of first-seen, full RBF, and zero-conf interactions are significant and controversial, and that given the current state of the discussion, and that full RBF may not solve the DoS issues that inspired it, the original PR would not have been merged in the first place.\r\n\r\nI believe we should leave first-seen mempool policy intact. The arguments for this include miner incentive compatibility, maximization of fees per block through next-block priority-competition, utility for merchants and consumers, intelligent double-spend risk mitigation, protection of the user space, and optimization of Bitcoin adoption, utility, and activity.\r\n\r\nI apologize for not yet having a reference link with full details of all of my arguments, but I am happy to interact with commenters on any arguments for a full RBF agenda here. I can also alleviate any concerns with current zero-conf acceptance risk mitigation.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate being heard, and having a fair chance to be reviewed and considered.\r\n\r\nI also need time for consideration because I am assisting some merchants and users with understanding how to interface with Bitcoin Core and what is happening, so they can express their support for this PR, and their value of zero-conf being useful as a service. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I am advocating for the Bitcoin network state that has thrived for its entire history so far, and asking that Bitcoin Core avoid steering policy.",
