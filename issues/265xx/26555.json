   "body" : "Right now the MuHash calculation in the functional test `feature_utxo_set_hash.py` is dependent on the specific chain we generate, e.g. it only works as long as the only spent coin is created in block number 1 (and no other UTXO is created in that same block) and uses that quirk to avoid the need to ever remove anything from the MuHash object.\r\n\r\nThis PR generalizes the MuHash calculation by systematically going through all blocks and taking all spent/created coins into account (reflecting the actual behaviour on the coinstatsindex), which allows to potentially create more complex test-cases for UTXO set hashes in the future.",
