Are these bandwidth savings worth the added code complexity?</i>\r\n\r\nThe project has received Concept ACK from many contributors, and no NACKs. I am unlikely to invent a bulletproof argument, so I leave it up to each reviewer to compare the risks and review costs to the benefits.\r\n\r\nI personally think that the added code is pretty straightforward because it communicates with a legacy code through a thin interface (100 LOC in `net_processing.cpp` to collect transactions instead of relaying them immediately, although the reconciliation code is 500 LOC -- excluding comments and minisketch). Hence it is acceptable to pay for the given optimization.\r\n\r\nIf you suggest any experiment that will convince you, I will do my best to execute it.\r\n\r\n</details>",
