It seems that currently no-one is working on that though and even if, it's likely too late to include it into the upcoming release v26 anyway. This PR is based on the assumption that the `loadtxoutset` RPC is released in its current form (if that's the case, we should add an \"EXPERIMENTAL\" warning) and given that, we shouldn't waste users time and leave them up to 10 minutes in the dark (creating the illusion that something useful happens in the background) until they get an error for an RPC that currently can only fail on mainnet. Or is the plan to deactivate `loadtxoutset` until #28620 is implemented?",
