   "body" : "I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro, M1, 2020, with 16MB RAM, running OS Sonoma 14.0.  A few months ago I had successfully downloaded the entire Bitcoin Core (V25) blockchain and I was updating daily without any issues.  I had my Sparrow wallet connected to Bitcoin Core and the blockchain was reflecting my BTC in my Sparrow wallet.  However, three days ago I received the fatal internal message pop-up message and Bitcoin Core froze completely.  I then deleted/removed Bitcoin Core from my Applications and from the external SDD. \r\n\r\nFor the past two days I have attempted to re-install Bitcoin Core (V25) on an external SDD (Lacie 2TB) after deleting/removing from my Applications and from the external SDD. After all the blocks headers have indexed, the blocks begin to download.  \r\n\r\nYesterday (October 7, 2023) I was accessing the internet via wireless and the download reached block height 222995 before I received the fatal internal message pop-up box: \r\n<img width=\"1099\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-07 at 4 46 18â¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/147281390/d9060837-223b-4ed3-9ffe-8aff7b9997e0\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1208\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-07 at 4 47 00â¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/147281390/1ba2e91e-734b-47b7-9fba-4d60e32ee828\">\r\n\r\nThe debug log from October 7 stated:\r\n<img width=\"644\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-07 at 4 51 44â¯PM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/147281390/0c562c21-0ee8-4a1f-ac19-bb4e0f1cf915\">\r\n\r\nToday (October 8, 2024) I was accessing the internet via a wired connection and the download reached block height 196461 before giving the same fatal internal error message pop-up message from yesterday:\r\n<img width=\"739\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 11 41 10â¯AM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/147281390/af143cc9-bd46-49f4-90f7-2eab49d42e36\">\r\n\r\nThe debug log from today stated:\r\n<img width=\"650\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-08 at 11 39 39â¯AM\" src=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/assets/147281390/be19bc3e-1814-493f-9f75-6155cb0b7ffa\">\r\n\r\nYesterday I ran Apple Diagnostics on my Mac and there are no issues with the internal SDD.  I also believe there are no issues with the external SDD.\r\n\r\nAny guidance on overcoming this issue will be greatly appreciated as I want to make sure I'm running my Sparrow wallet with my Bitcoin Core node.\r\n\r\nThank you, Phil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
