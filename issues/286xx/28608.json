Not locking cs_main while validating assumeutxo snapshots, so the node is responsive when the background chainstate download finishes.\r\n2. Deleting the background chainstate right away when it is no longer needed, instead of waiting until the next restart, which takes up extra disk space and slows down the next startup.",
