      "body" : "There's a glitch in this implementation though, probably not a big deal in practice. Because it relies on `blockConnected` to update the icon, if you restart the node during background sync, then the transaction will show as fully confirmed briefly - until the next block is connected.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, once background sync finishes, it will show as partially confirmed until a new block comes in. Since we don't show background validation progress yet in the GUI, this glitch would only be noticed by someone looking at the log.\r\n\r\nNot sure how involved fixing that is.",
