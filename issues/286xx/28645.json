   "body" : "Two recently added tests (PR #28625 / commit 2e31250027ac580a7a72221fe2ff505b30836175 and PR #28634 / commit 3bb51c29df596aab2c1fde184667cee435597715) introduced bugs by wrongly using the `assert_debug_log` helper:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5ea4fc05edde66c5c90383bc054590dfbdb2b645/test/functional/feature_assumeutxo.py#L84-L85 \r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5ea4fc05edde66c5c90383bc054590dfbdb2b645/test/functional/p2p_v2_transport.py#L148\r\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/5ea4fc05edde66c5c90383bc054590dfbdb2b645/test/functional/p2p_v2_transport.py#L159\r\n\r\nInstead of passing the expected debug string in a list as expected, it was passed as bare string, which is then interpretered as a list of characters, very likely leading the debug log assertion pass even if the intended message is not appearing. Thanks to maflcko for discovering: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28625#discussion_r1356489861\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid bugs like this in the future, enforce that the `{un}expected_msgs` parameters are lists, as discussed in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28625#discussion_r1356864233. Using mypy might be an alternative, but I guess it takes quite a bit of effort to properly integrate this into CI for the whole functional test suite (including taking care of false-positives), so I decided to go with the simpler \"manual asserts\" hack. Suggestions are very welcome of course.",
