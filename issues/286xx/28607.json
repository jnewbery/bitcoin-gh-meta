   "body" : "This issue will be updated to reflect the current state of CMake integration.\r\n\r\nA brief historical context:\r\n1. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 proposed a CMake-based build system with 100% feature parity to the Autotools-based one.\r\n2. The reviewing process is happening in this [repo](https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin) as suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27060#issuecomment-1431798320.\r\n3. The recent discussion at CoreDev -- https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2023-09/cmake/\r\n\r\nHow reviewing happens:\r\n1. Pull requests are opened against the https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/tree/cmake-staging branch.\r\n2. After reviewing and merging them, the staging branch get synced with the main branch from this repo.\r\n4. This loop continues until all commits from https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25797 get reviewed.\r\n\r\nThe planned chunks of work:\r\n- [x] The root `CMakeLists.txt` and `config/bitcoin-config.h` files -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/5\r\n- [x] Project-wide system introspections; the `leveldb` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/6\r\n- [x] The `bitcoind` build target -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/7\r\n- [x] Cross-compiling support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/10\r\n- [x] Ccache support; `libnatpmp`, `libminiupnpc`, `libzmq` and `systemtap-sdt` optional packages support -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13\r\n- [x] Utility binaries, wallet functionality, `bench_bitcoijn` and `test_bitcoin` -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/15\r\n- [x] Handling different build configurations -- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/18\r\n- [ ] Hardening, shared libraries\r\n- [ ] Qt stuff\r\n- [ ] Guix builds\r\n- [ ] Building for fuzzing\r\n- [ ] Building for Android\r\n- [ ] CI stuff\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe current minimum required CMake version is 3.13, which is the system [package](https://packages.debian.org/buster/cmake) on [Debian 10](https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/). Considering the timings of Debian 10 LTS EOL and integrating CMake into this repo, it seems reasonable to bump the minimum supported version up to 3.16, which is the system [package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/cmake) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bump minimum supported CMake version from 3.13 up to 3.16\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo hold the 100% feature parity, the current CMake-based build system implementation can autodetect an optional package and enable it as Autotools-based one does. However, it was suggested to make all optional package opt-in by default. See:\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1156251913\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/12#discussion_r1157570678\r\n- https://github.com/hebasto/bitcoin/pull/13#discussion_r1164377093\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make all optional package opt-in by default\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nAutotools -- CMake Feature Parity Table is available [here](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/2ef97d3a726bfce08ded9df07f7dab5e).\r\n\r\nTo list CMake's options, one might add the `-LH` option during configuring step.",
