      "body" : "The idea here is to restructure `CNode` / `CConnman` / `PeerManager` a bit. Currently, net.h combines all the p2p logic in between the very low-level socket stuff (sock.h) and the high-level protocol (net_processing.h). This splits that into two parts: node/node.h that now contains `CNode`, `TransportV1`, etc that focusses on dealing with a single peer; and leaves `CConnman` in net.h, with the idea that that focusses on coordinating amongst the many peers we have (so, opening new connections, choosing what to evict, working out which node to give cpu time to next, etc).\r\n\r\nThis PR just moves code around; the idea is that future PRs would improve the separation more (see https://github.com/ajtowns/bitcoin/commits/202308-netnode and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28252#issuecomment-1680222391) and, eventually, breaking the circular dependency between `PeerManager` and `CConnman` (ie, have `PeerManager` only deal with a single node at a time, eg see the `PushMessage` changes in the repo just mentioned).",
