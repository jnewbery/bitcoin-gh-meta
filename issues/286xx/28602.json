   "body" : "`InferDescriptor` was not always checking that the pubkey it was placing into the descriptor was an allowed pubkey. For example, given a P2WPKH script that uses an uncompressed pubkey, it would produce a `wpkh()` with the uncompressed key. Additionally, the hybrid key check was only being done for `pk()` scripts, where it should've been done for all scripts.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the key checking into `InferPubkey`. If the key is not valid for the context, then `nullptr` is returned and the inferring will fall through to the defaults of either `raw()` or `addr()`.\r\n\r\nThis also resolves an issue with migrating legacy wallets that contain hybrid pubkeys as such watchonly scripts will become `raw()` or `addr()` and go to the watchonly wallet. Note that a legacy wallet cannot sign for hybrid pubkeys. A test has been added for the migration case.\r\n\r\nAlso added unit tests for `InferDescriptor` itself as the edge cases with that function are not covered by the descriptor roundtrip test.",
