There should be another RPC to monitor the status.\n\n### Is your feature related to a problem, if so please describe it.\n\n1. `loadtxoutset` takes too long, even requiring `-rpctimeout=0`. This makes it hard for potential integrations like Umbrel, BTCPay server or Specter desktop to show progress.\r\n\r\n2. Progress can only be followed via the debug log, which is too noisy during IBD.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIt could follow the same pattern as `scanblocks`, with `start`, `status` and `abort`. The latter two won't need an argument. This would not be backwards compatible, but imo that's fine as long as it lands before mainnet support.\n\n### Describe any alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Please leave any additional context\n\n_No response_",
