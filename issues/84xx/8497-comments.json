I think it would be possible to use an initial balance calculated through the UTXO set. Although I'm not sure if we want to support a such feature in Bitcoin-Core. Also the missing history could confuse users, it would lead to districting imported key during pruned blockchains, labeling them different on RPC as well as on the GUI level.\n",

And please, don't all it a \"pruned wallet\", the word \"prune\" is already over-used in bitcoin-land (ultra-prune #1677, pruned blockchains, ....). And people, for fact, already call a blockchain-pruning Bitcoin Core instance a \"pruned wallet\". Let's find another name for limited-history wallets.\n\nBTW see also #5389.\n",
