A node sets `m_protect=true` for a a maximum of 4 outbound peers (`MAX_OUTBOUND_PEERS_TO_PROTECT_FROM_DISCONNECT`) that have announced blocks to us that have improved our tip. See [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/ba907f96ad37c09c49c0e1532fad118fcb8dd4a8/src/net_processing.cpp#L2880-L2886) for the code on master.\r\nIt is also never set for inbound peers, so if an \"Adversary connects to Bitcoin\" it won't be protected by it.\r\n",
