      "body" : "I agree more moderation would be useful, but I would propose something more lightweight and less prescriptive than a code of conduct. I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\n- Who is currently banned\r\n- What specific reasons they were banned for, with links to relevant issues or comments\r\n- When the ban will end\r\n- Who made the decision to ban them\r\n\r\nI think it would be good if bans were fairly short, starting at a few days and not lasting more than a few months.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a good approach because a ban does not need to imply that anyone has done something wrong or immoral, it could just be a tool for allowing overheated discussions to cool off.",
