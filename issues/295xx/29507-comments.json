I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\n- Who is currently banned\r\n- What specific reasons they were banned for, with links to relevant issues or comments\r\n- When the ban will end\r\n- Who made the decision to ban them\r\n\r\nI think it would be good if bans were fairly short, starting at a few days and not lasting more than a few months.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a good approach because a ban does not need to imply that anyone has done something wrong or immoral, it could just be a tool for allowing overheated discussions to cool off.",

In this regard, the Linux kernel's code of conduct could serve as an exemplary model. Given the anticipated expansion of Bitcoin Core, especially in terms of contributor numbers, it could soon rival the scale of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I have concerns about potential misuse of this tool that must be addressed. Specifically, the issues already highlighted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890 raise valid points regarding how the code of conduct could be exploited to sow discord within the community and incite unnecessary conflicts. It is imperative that measures are put in place to prevent such outcomes, however I'm unsure of how that could be achieved. I guess that having a code of conduct, in the context of Bitcoin Core, might paradoxically serve as a double-edged sword, obtaining the opposite result of what is intended if not properly used.",
