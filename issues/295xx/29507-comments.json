I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\n- Who is currently banned\r\n- What specific reasons they were banned for, with links to relevant issues or comments\r\n- When the ban will end\r\n- Who made the decision to ban them\r\n\r\nI think it would be good if bans were fairly short, starting at a few days and not lasting more than a few months.\r\n\r\nI think this could be a good approach because a ban does not need to imply that anyone has done something wrong or immoral, it could just be a tool for allowing overheated discussions to cool off.",

In this regard, the Linux kernel's code of conduct could serve as an exemplary model. Given the anticipated expansion of Bitcoin Core, especially in terms of contributor numbers, it could soon rival the scale of the Linux kernel.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I have concerns about potential misuse of this tool that must be addressed. Specifically, the issues already highlighted in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890 raise valid points regarding how the code of conduct could be exploited to sow discord within the community and incite unnecessary conflicts. It is imperative that measures are put in place to prevent such outcomes, however I'm unsure of how that could be achieved. I guess that having a code of conduct, in the context of Bitcoin Core, might paradoxically serve as a double-edged sword, obtaining the opposite result of what is intended if not properly used.",

They all really just outline the kind of space that they want to foster for their respective projects, some pointers on how to achieve that, and some things to not do. I think they're fairly loose and don't really prescribe how people must actually behave nor necessarily exact things that would be violations or specific consequences for doing so. Rather, they do seem to all just state that they want their communities to be welcoming and respectful, and if anyone feels like that is being violated, they can report a CoC violation.\r\n\r\n> I think we should try short-term bans of posters who causing specific problems, with full transparency so it's clear:\r\n\r\nSure, but the question has always been what behaviors do contributors think are ban worthy, and the lack of any guidelines for that is what brings up this issue.\r\n\r\n> maybe we could consider opening a new repository like bitcoin-core/moderation or bitcoin-core/gh to track issues like this related to moderation, or management of the github org.\r\n\r\nI agree with having these kinds of issues be in a separate place. I think the Discussions feature could be used for this as well.\r\n\r\n> For what it's worth, I think it will be extremely difficult to prevent the weaponization of the loose language, including the requirement to accept veiled criticism and encouraging weaponized demands for apologies.\r\n\r\nIIRC this is a criticism of the specific text proposed in the previous PR, but the point of this one is not to propose a specific text yet. It's not clear to me how the examples I've linked to would require accepting veiled criticism or encourage weaponized demands for apologies, so I think this problem can be avoided by using different language.\r\n\r\n> See also http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8609\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this is open source and no one is obligated to work with you. You could be a genius super coder, but be a complete asshole that is hard to work with, and it is everyone's right to decide to never speak with you. Being good at something doesn't give you the right to force everyone to listen to you.\r\n\r\n[Well-kept Gardens Die By Pacifism](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tscc3e5eujrsEeFN4/well-kept-gardens-die-by-pacifism) and I certainly think we're well on the road to death considering how little moderation occurs in this repo and the IRC channel. We can even see from the [2023's contributor survey results](https://adamjonas.com/bitcoin/coredev/retro/coredev-2023-retro/) that the number of contributors has been steadily decreasing and that disruption from both contributors and non-contributors have been a major frustration in the past couple years. I do not want to suggest that there is evidence for a direct causal link between lacking moderation and fewer contributors, but it's not so much a stretch to say that this may be a factor, among many others. More active moderation and a guidelines for that moderation (whether that be a code of conduct or something else) seems like proper way to resolve these issues.",

      "body" : "> As such, I think it would be prudent for us to reconsider adding a Code of Conduct or otherwise some written rules of moderation so that moderation actions can be taken more proactively.\r\n\r\nLike I said [last time](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26890#issuecomment-1382673362), I think more proactive moderation is a good idea, but adding a code of conduct will likely cause more problems than it solves. Moderation is naturally a judgement call, and either people support the people making those judgement calls or they don't. Trying to specify what's good behaviour just encourages lawyer-style parsing of the terms, and if you're just talking in generalities like \"be excellent to each other\" you're not really providing any help to the people who might actually want some help.\r\n\r\nIf mods/others want to write some \"how to constructively engage with other contributors\" advice (like productivity.md or developer-notes.md) that's likely fine, and allows for a positive focus on good behaviour rather than a negative one on the worst contributors. (\"oops, I got moderated, how should I react?\" might be a good question to have an answer for, for people who're trying to be constructive, but don't always succeed, and are afraid that more proactive moderation might cause them to be exiled/excommunicated)\r\n\r\nIf repo admins/mods want to have a private wiki page with some bullet points for what should be moderated and what shouldn't so they can be consistent with each other, especially in the early days of being more proactive, that probably also makes sense. (Trying to coordinate a response to attackers while being completely transparent in all your plans on how you'll respond seems like a losing bet to me, so beyond [ryanofsky's suggestions](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29507#issuecomment-1970112884) about making it possible to audit the actual actions taken, I think there are limits on how much transparency is a good thing)\r\n\r\n(To be explicit: I don't support adding a code of conduct, however I do support the current repo admins being more proactive in moderating comments, even if they insist on making a code of conduct as part of doing so)",
