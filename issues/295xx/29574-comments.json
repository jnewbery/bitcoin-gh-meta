      "body" : "This is because all the seeds we have for testnet are `NET_ONION`: https://paste.256k1.dev/xosamodiga.log and so get filtered by the predicate in `ThreadOpenConnections`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nseed_addrs.erase(std::remove_if(seed_addrs.begin(), seed_addrs.end(),\r\n                                [&fixed_seed_networks](const CAddress& addr) { return fixed_seed_networks.count(addr.GetNetwork()) == 0; }),\r\n                 seed_addrs.end());\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gdb\r\n>>> p fixed_seed_networks\r\n$3 = std::unordered_set with 2 elements = {\r\n  [0] = NET_IPV6,\r\n  [1] = NET_IPV4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, as far as I can tell it doesn't appear that we have **ever** had ipv4 seeds for testnet? So perhaps this is a (historical and) purposeful decision. It appears this has been the case since [2014](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a60120e951ae94d0553c5515229432e016fb0657) when this file was introduced. I roughly checked a few version previous and only found references to mainnet seeds. This would seem like an odd decision to me though, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\r\n\r\nFor mainnet we have _nodes_main.txt_ which includes auto-fetched addresses from a dns seeder, and _nodes_main_manual.txt_ which adds onion and I2P seeds.\r\nBy contrast for testnet _nodes_test.txt_ is not in fact ipv4 addresses, but manually-added tor v3 addresses.\r\n\r\nIf we want testnet nodes to be able to sync without relying on dns seeds then we should consider adding some testnet IPV4 addresses.",
