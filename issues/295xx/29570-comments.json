Or will there be some whitelist which, if you are not on it, will see your new issues/PRs flagged? Or perhaps you meant something else?\r\n\r\n> A simple spam management policy could be to have every Github user email endpoint timestamped in the Bitcoin blockchain at least 144 blocks before the current BIP113 median time-past.\r\n\r\nHow would stamping their email address into the blockchain combat spam in this example?",
