   "body" : "This PR contains changes to `TxOrphanage` needed for package relay stuff. See #27463 for project tracking and #28031 for how this code is used.\r\n\r\nSeparating this PR was suggested in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28031#discussion_r1261414179.\r\n\r\nChanges here:\r\n- Change params to wtxid instead of txid.\r\n- Track total size (`CTransaction::GetTotalSize()` of orphans stored, as well as the size per peer.\r\n- Support having multiple announcers for the same tx. This helps us retry resolving the same orphan with multiple peers if it fails the first time.\r\n- Store the deduplicated missing parent txids in `OrphanTx` so that we don't need to calculate them again later on.\r\n- Return the erased wtxids from `EraseForBlock` which includes orphans that conflicted with the block. This helps us delete those orphan resolution attempts from our tracker.\r\n- Enable limiting the total size of orphans instead of just the total count. No new limits are introduced, the default is maximum count * maximum tx size.\r\n- Unit tests + fuzzer.",
