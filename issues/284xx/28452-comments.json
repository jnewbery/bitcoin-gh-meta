E.g. if the capacity is under 64 KiB, don't wipe.\r\n\r\nI considered that before, but wasn't sure it'd be worth the discussion. We're already doing several allocations per P2P message already in various places, some of which will require more refactoring to get rid of, so one more or less probably doesn't matter that much.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, I wanted to just make it do what it was intending to do already.",
