It still seems safer to keep it explicit, so an application developer or cli user doesn't shoot themselves in the foot. As mentioned in https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28454#issuecomment-1718001107, this change would violate behaving in a way that most users will expect it to behave, and in a less secure direction. So I'm quite hesitant here.\r\n",
