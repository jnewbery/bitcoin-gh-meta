So this change isn't relevant unless a peer send us a block they mutated on purpose, in which case they get disconnected for that. So it really shouldn't change anything in a  non-adversarial scenario.\r\n\r\n2) If we break early and don't compute the full merkle root anymore, the return value of `BlockMerkleRoot()` changes. As a result, [code calling BlockMerkleRoot()](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f7b9eb8711fdb32e8bdb59d2a7462a46c7a8086/src/validation.cpp#L3534-L3542) https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/8f7b9eb8711fdb32e8bdb59d2a7462a46c7a8086/src/validation.cpp#L3534-L3542  would now return \"bad-txnmrklroot\" as an error instead of \"bad-txns-duplicate\", because now the first check already fails. This seems incorrect.\r\n\r\n3) I don't think it's wise to change consensus-critical code like this without a tangible benefit, see discussion in #22046",
