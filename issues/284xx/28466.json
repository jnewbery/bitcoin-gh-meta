   "body" : "### Motivation\n\nSome unit tests use a deterministic random number generator where all generated numbers are deterministically derived from a given starting number (seed) which is generated \"randomly\". Those tests can detect bugs and fail accordingly based on the random numbers produced by the generator. It is very useful if it is possible to reproduce a test failure.\r\n\r\nThus it would be very useful to print the seed, so that if a test fails, that failure can later be reproduced by providing the same seed via the `RANDOM_CTX_SEED` environment variable.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the CI `multiprocess, i686, DEBUG` the seed is printed (it uses `DEBUG_LOG_OUT`), but is not printed for `previous releases, qt5 dev package and depends packages, DEBUG` (it does not use `DEBUG_LOG_OUT`).\n\n### Possible solution\n\nUse `DEBUG_LOG_OUT` also in `previous releases, qt5 dev package and depends packages, DEBUG`.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28196#discussion_r1317185255\n\n### Useful Skills\n\n* Compiling Bitcoin Core from source\r\n* Running the C++ unit tests\r\n\n\n### Guidance for new contributors\n\nWant to work on this issue?\r\n\r\nFor guidance on contributing, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening your pull request.\r\n",
