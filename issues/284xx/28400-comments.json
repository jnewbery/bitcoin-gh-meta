      "body" : "Changing the `IsUnspendable` logic in general seems very brittle, as it obviously leads to nodes with diverging UTXO sets. Even if _all_ nodes would run this patch, they'd start to run it at different block heights (if between blocks M and N an UTXO enters the set that classifies for pruning, you'd already diverge), and you'd only end up with the same fully pruned UTXO set if all of them also did a `-reindex` once.\r\n\r\nWhen the pruning of OP_RETURN outputs was implemented over 10 years ago (see https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2791) this was seemingly less of a problem, but now that many projects depend on a normalized view of the UTXO set (muhash, assumeutxo, utreexo etc.), I think that would lead to much unwanted chaos.\r\n\r\nHappy to hear other inputs how this could be solved, maybe I'm missing something.",
