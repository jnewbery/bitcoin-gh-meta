   "body" : "It appears that invoking `v = {};` for an `std::vector<...> v` is equivalent to `v.clear()`, which does not release its allocated memory. There are a number of places in the codebase where it appears to be used for that purpose however (mostly written by me). Replace those with `v.clear(); v.shrink_to_fit();`.\r\n\r\nTo explain what is going on: `v = {...};` is equivalent in general to `v.operator=({...});`. For many types, the `{}` is converted to the type of `v`, and then assigned to `v` - which for `std::vector` would ordinarily have the effect of clearing its memory (constructing a new empty vector, and then move-assigning it to `v`). However, since `std::vector<T>` has an `operator=(std::initializer_list<T>)` defined, it has precedence (since no implicit conversion is needed), and with an empty list, that is equivalent to `clear()`.\r\n\r\nI did consider using `v = std::vector<T>{};` as replacement for `v = {};` instances where memory releasing is desired, but it appears that it does not actually work universally either. `v.clear(); v.shrink_to_fit();` does.",
