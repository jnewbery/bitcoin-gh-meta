   "body" : "Choose whether witness is included in transaction serialization via serialization parameter rather than the stream version. See #25284 and #19477 for previous context.\r\n\r\nWhy is this draft?\r\n * This touches consensus code. Might make sense to merge it shortly after the 26.0 release, so it can bake for as long a time as possible before being included in released code?\r\n * It removes support for `-rpcserialversion`.\r\n   * This is mainly because that uses `RPCSerializationFlags()` and `rpcSerializationFlags()` interfaces which don't really match the new model.\r\n   * Is that option even worth keeping at this point, now that downstream projects have implemented segwit?\r\n   * If it's not worth keeping, should we deprecate the option in 26.0 before removing it in 27.0?\r\n   * Should we replace it with a `strip_witness` options for some rpcs, eg `getblock`?",
