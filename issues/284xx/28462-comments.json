That would help to understand the impact of such a patch.\r\n\r\nAlso, do you think netgroup limitation stuff would need to change? Would these connections be diversified separately, or together with tx-relay peers?\r\n\r\nOtherwise I don't see any issues, so this is probably a good idea. I agree with the next step:\r\n> We need users to adopt the changes to increase the default for inbound block-relay-only connections before we can safely increase the default for outbounds",
