   "body" : "This is also a much simpler replacement for #28327.\r\n\r\nThere are version fields in `CBlockLocator` and `CDiskBlockIndex` that have always been written but discarded when read.\r\n\r\nI intended to convert them to use SerParams as introduced by #25284, which [ended up looking like this](https://github.com/theuni/bitcoin/commit/3e3af451652322c92e8e41cf918e69d608ec7c77). However because we don't currently have any definition of what a hash value would mean for either one of those, and we've never assigned the version field any meaning, I think it's better to just not worry about them.\r\n\r\nIf we ever need to assign meaning in the future, we can introduce `SerParams` as was done for `CAddress`.\r\n\r\nAs for the dummy values chosen:\r\n\r\n`CDiskBlockIndex::DUMMY_VERSION` was easy as the highest ever client version, and I don't expect any objection there.\r\n\r\n`CBlockLocator::DUMMY_VERSION` is hard-coded to the higest _PROTOCOL_ version ever used. This is to avoid a sudden bump that would be visible on the network if CLIENT_VERSION were used instead. In the future, if we ever need to use the value, we can discard anything in the CLIENT_VERSION range (for a few years as needed), as it's quite a bit higher.\r\n\r\nWhile reviewing, I suggest looking at the throwaway `SerParams` commit above as it shows where the call-sites are. I believe that should be enough to convince one's self that hashing is never used.",
