Afaict this is only a problem if the spawned threads are also used (e.g. `join`) in the target.\r\n\r\nA potential fix would be to call `initialize` after `__AFL_INIT` but prior to `__AFL_LOOP`, which will however lead to slower fuzzing for all targets.\r\n\r\n(I'm uncertain why oss-fuzz does not report the timeouts to us but that seems like an issue on their end)",
